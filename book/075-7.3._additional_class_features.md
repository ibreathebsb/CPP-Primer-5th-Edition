<h3 id="filepos1851857">7.3. Additional Class Features</h3>
<p>The <code>Sales_data</code> class is pretty simple, yet it allowed us to explore quite a bit of the language support for classes. In this section, we’ll cover some additional class-related features that <code>Sales_data</code> doesn’t need to use. These features include type members, in-class initializers for members of class type, <code>mutable</code> data members, <code>inline</code> member functions, returning <code>*this</code> from a member function, more about how we define and use class types, and class friendship.</p>
<h4 id="filepos1852806">7.3.1. Class Members Revisited</h4>
<p>To explore several of these additional features, we’ll define a pair of cooperating classes named <code>Screen</code> and <code>Window_mgr</code>.</p>
<h5>Defining a Type Member</h5>
<p>A <code>Screen</code> represents a window on a display. Each <code>Screen</code> has a <code>string</code> member that holds the <code>Screen</code>’s contents, and three <code>string::size_type</code> members that represent the position of the cursor, and the height and width of the screen.</p>
<p>In addition to defining data and function members, a class can define its own local names for types. Type names defined by a class are subject to the same access controls as any other member and may be either <code>public</code> or <code>private</code>:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    typedef std::string::size_type pos;
private:
    pos cursor = 0;
    pos height = 0, width = 0;
    std::string contents;
};
```

<p><a id="filepos1854918"></a>We defined <code>pos</code> in the <code>public</code> part of <code>Screen</code> because we want users to use that name. Users of <code>Screen</code> shouldn’t know that <code>Screen</code> uses a <code>string</code> to hold its data. By defining <code>pos</code> as a <code>public</code> member, we can hide this detail of how <code>Screen</code> is implemented.</p>
<p>There are two points to note about the declaration of <code>pos</code>. First, although we used a <code>typedef</code> (§ <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos536134">2.5.1</a>, p. <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos536134">67</a>), we can equivalently use a type alias (§ <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos536134">2.5.1</a>, p. <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos536134">68</a>):</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    // alternative way to declare a type member using a type alias
    using pos = std::string::size_type;
    // other members as before
};
```

<p>The second point is that, for reasons we’ll explain in § <a href="076-7.4._class_scope.html#filepos1931587">7.4.1</a> (p. <a href="076-7.4._class_scope.html#filepos1931587">284</a>), unlike ordinary members, members that define types must appear before they are used. As a result, type members usually appear at the beginning of the class.</p>
<h5>Member Functions of class <code>Screen</code></h5>
<p>To make our class more useful, we’ll add a constructor that will let users define the size and contents of the screen, along with members to move the cursor and to get the character at a given location:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    typedef std::string::size_type pos;
    Screen() = default; // needed because Screen has another constructor
    // cursor initialized to 0 by its in-class initializer
    Screen(pos ht, pos wd, char c): height(ht), width(wd),
                                    contents(ht * wd, c) { }
    char get() const              // get the character at the cursor
        { return contents[cursor]; }       // implicitly inline
    inline char get(pos ht, pos wd) const; // explicitly inline
    Screen &move(pos r, pos c);      // can be made inline later
private:
    pos cursor = 0;
    pos height = 0, width = 0;
    std::string contents;
};
```

<p>Because we have provided a constructor, the compiler will not automatically generate a default constructor for us. If our class is to have a default constructor, we must say so explicitly. In this case, we use <code>= default</code> to ask the compiler to synthesize the default constructor’s definition for us (§ <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">7.1.4</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">264</a>).</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that our second constructor (that takes three arguments) implicitly uses the in-class initializer for the <code>cursor</code> member (§ <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">7.1.4</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">266</a>). If our class did not have an in-class initializer for <code>cursor</code>, we would have explicitly initialized <code>cursor</code> along with the other members.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos1861412"></a>Making Members <code>inline</code></h5>
<p>Classes often have small functions that can benefit from being inlined. As we’ve seen, member functions defined inside the class are automatically <code>inline</code> (§ <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">6.5.2</a>, p. <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">238</a>). Thus, <code>Screen</code>’s constructors and the version of <code>get</code> that returns the character denoted by the cursor are <code>inline</code> by default.</p>
<p>We can explicitly declare a member function as <code>inline</code> as part of its declaration inside the class body. Alternatively, we can specify <code>inline</code> on the function definition that appears outside the class body:</p>

```c++
inline                   // we can specify inline on the definition
Screen &Screen::move(pos r, pos c)
{
    pos row = r * width; // compute the row location
    cursor = row + c ;   // move cursor to the column within that row
    return *this;        // return this object as an lvalue
}
char Screen::get(pos r, pos c) const // declared as inline in the class
{
    pos row = r * width;      // compute row location
    return contents[row + c]; // return character at the given column
}
```

<p>Although we are not required to do so, it is legal to specify <code>inline</code> on both the declaration and the definition. However, specifying <code>inline</code> only on the definition outside the class can make the class easier to read.</p>

::: info
<p>For the same reasons that we define <code>inline</code> functions in headers (§ <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">6.5.2</a>, p. <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">240</a>), <code>inline</code> member functions should be defined in the same header as the corresponding class definition.</p>
:::

<h5>Overloading Member Functions</h5>
<p>As with nonmember functions, member functions may be overloaded (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">6.4</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">230</a>) so long as the functions differ by the number and/or types of parameters. The same function-matching (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">6.4</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">233</a>) process is used for calls to member functions as for nonmember functions.</p>
<p>For example, our <code>Screen</code> class defined two versions of <code>get</code>. One version returns the character currently denoted by the cursor; the other returns the character at a given position specified by its row and column. The compiler uses the number of arguments to determine which version to run:</p>

```c++
Screen myscreen;
char ch = myscreen.get();// calls Screen::get()
ch = myscreen.get(0,0);  // calls Screen::get(pos, pos)
```

<h5><code>mutable</code> Data Members</h5>
<p>It sometimes (but not very often) happens that a class has a data member that we want to be able to modify, even inside a <code>const</code> member function. We indicate such members by including the <code>mutable</code> keyword in their declaration.</p>
<p><a id="filepos1868141"></a>A <a href="080-defined_terms.html#filepos2063603" id="filepos1868151"><code>mutable</code>
<strong>data member</strong></a> is never <code>const</code>, even when it is a member of a <code>const</code> object. Accordingly, a <code>const</code> member function may change a <code>mutable</code> member. As an example, we’ll give <code>Screen</code> a <code>mutable</code> member named <code>access_ctr</code>, which we’ll use to track how often each <code>Screen</code> member function is called:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    void some_member() const;
private:
    mutable size_t access_ctr; // may change even in a const object
    // other members as before
};
void Screen::some_member() const
{
    ++access_ctr;    // keep a count of the calls to any member function
    // whatever other work this member needs to do
}
```

<p>Despite the fact that <code>some_member</code> is a <code>const</code> member function, it can change the value of <code>access_ctr</code>. That member is a <code>mutable</code> member, so any member function, including <code>const</code> functions, can change its value.</p>
<h5>Initializers for Data Members of Class Type</h5>
<a id="filepos1871041"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>In addition to defining the <code>Screen</code> class, we’ll define a window manager class that represents a collection of <code>Screens</code> on a given display. This class will have a <code>vector</code> of <code>Screen</code>s in which each element represents a particular <code>Screen</code>. By default, we’d like our <code>Window_mgr</code> class to start up with a single, default-initialized <code>Screen</code>. Under the new standard, the best way to specify this default value is as an in-class initializer (§ <a href="026-2.6._defining_our_own_data_structures.html#filepos578460">2.6.1</a>, p. <a href="026-2.6._defining_our_own_data_structures.html#filepos578460">73</a>):</p>

```c++
class Window_mgr {
private:
    // Screens this Window_mgr is tracking
    // by default, a Window_mgr has one standard sized blank Screen
    std::vector<Screen> screens{Screen(24, 80, ' ') };
};
```

<p>When we initialize a member of class type, we are supplying arguments to a constructor of that member’s type. In this case, we list initialize our <code>vector</code> member (§ <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos744172">3.3.1</a>, p. <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos744172">98</a>) with a single element initializer. That initializer contains a <code>Screen</code> value that is passed to the <code>vector&lt;Screen&gt;</code> constructor to create a one-element <code>vector</code>. That value is created by the <code>Screen</code> constructor that takes two size parameters and a character to create a blank screen of the given size.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, in-class initializers must use either the <code>=</code> form of initialization (which we used when we initialized the the data members of <code>Screen</code>) or the direct form of initialization using curly braces (as we do for <code>screens</code>).</p>

::: info
<p>When we provide an in-class initializer, we must do so following an <code>=</code> sign or inside braces.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 7.24:</strong> Give your <code>Screen</code> class three constructors: a default constructor; a constructor that takes values for height and width and initializes the contents to hold the given number of blanks; and a constructor that takes values for height, width, and a character to use as the contents of the screen.</p>

:::

<h4 id="filepos1876631">7.3.2. Functions That Return <code>*this</code></h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Next we’ll add functions to set the character at the cursor or at a given location:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    Screen &set(char);
    Screen &set(pos, pos, char);
    // other members as before
};
inline Screen &Screen::set(char c)
{
    contents[cursor] = c; // set the new value at the current cursor location
    return *this;         // return this object as an lvalue
}
inline Screen &Screen::set(pos r, pos col, char ch)
{
    contents[r*width + col] = ch;  // set specified location to given value
    return *this;                  // return this object as an lvalue
}
```

<p>Like the <code>move</code> operation, our <code>set</code> members return a reference to the object on which they are called (§ <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1761316">7.1.2</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1761316">259</a>). Functions that return a reference are lvalues (§ <a href="065-6.3._return_types_and_the_return_statement.html#filepos1552941">6.3.2</a>, p. <a href="065-6.3._return_types_and_the_return_statement.html#filepos1552941">226</a>), which means that they return the object itself, not a copy of the object. If we concatenate a sequence of these actions into a single expression:</p>

```c++
// move the cursor to a given position, and set that character
myScreen.move(4,0).set('#');
```

<p>these operations will execute on the same object. In this expression, we first <code>move</code> the <code>cursor</code> inside <code>myScreen</code> and then <code>set</code> a character in <code>myScreen</code>’s <code>contents</code> member. That is, this statement is equivalent to</p>

```c++
myScreen.move(4,0);
myScreen.set('#');
```

<p>Had we defined <code>move</code> and <code>set</code> to return <code>Screen</code>, rather than <code>Screen&amp;</code>, this statement would execute quite differently. In this case it would be equivalent to:</p>
<p><a id="filepos1880963"></a></p>

```c++
// if move returns Screen not Screen&
Screen temp = myScreen.move(4,0);  // the return value would be copied
temp.set('#'); // the contents inside myScreen would be unchanged
```

<p>If <code>move</code> had a nonreference return type, then the return value of <code>move</code> would be a copy of <code>*this</code> (§ <a href="065-6.3._return_types_and_the_return_statement.html#filepos1552941">6.3.2</a>, p. <a href="065-6.3._return_types_and_the_return_statement.html#filepos1552941">224</a>). The call to <code>set</code> would change the temporary copy, not <code>myScreen</code>.</p>
<h5>Returning <code>*this</code> from a <code>const</code> Member Function</h5>
<p>Next, we’ll add an operation, which we’ll name <code>display</code>, to print the contents of the <code>Screen</code>. We’d like to be able to include this operation in a sequence of <code>set</code> and <code>move</code> operations. Therefore, like <code>set</code> and <code>move</code>, our <code>display</code> function will return a reference to the object on which it executes.</p>
<p>Logically, displaying a <code>Screen</code> doesn’t change the object, so we should make <code>display</code> a <code>const</code> member. If <code>display</code> is a <code>const</code> member, then <code>this</code> is a pointer to <code>const</code> and <code>*this</code> is a <code>const</code> object. Hence, the return type of <code>display</code> must be <code>const Sales_data&amp;</code>. However, if <code>display</code> returns a reference to <code>const</code>, we won’t be able to embed <code>display</code> into a series of actions:</p>

```c++
Screen myScreen;
// if display returns a const reference, the call to set is an error
myScreen.display(cout).set('*');
```

<p>Even though <code>myScreen</code> is a non<code>const</code> object, the call to <code>set</code> won’t compile. The problem is that the <code>const</code> version of <code>display</code> returns a reference to <code>const</code> and we cannot call <code>set</code> on a <code>const</code> object.</p>

::: info
<p>A <code>const</code> member function that returns <code>*this</code> as a reference should have a return type that is a reference to <code>const</code>.</p>
:::

<h5>Overloading Based on <code>const</code></h5>
<p>We can overload a member function based on whether it is <code>const</code> for the same reasons that we can overload a function based on whether a pointer parameter points to <code>const</code> (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">6.4</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">232</a>). The non<code>const</code> version will not be viable for <code>const</code> objects; we can only call <code>const</code> member functions on a <code>const</code> object. We can call either version on a non<code>const</code> object, but the non<code>const</code> version will be a better match.</p>
<p>In this example, we’ll define a <code>private</code> member named <code>do_display</code> to do the actual work of printing the <code>Screen</code>. Each of the <code>display</code> operations will call this function and then return the object on which it is executing:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    // display overloaded on whether the object is const or not
    Screen &display(std::ostream &os)
                  { do_display(os); return *this; }
    const Screen &display(std::ostream &os) const
                  { do_display(os); return *this; }
private:
     // function to do the work of displaying a Screen
     void do_display(std::ostream &os) const {os << contents;}
    // other members as before
};
```

<p>As in any other context, when one member calls another the <code>this</code> pointer is passed implicitly. Thus, when <code>display</code> calls <code>do_display</code>, its own <code>this</code> pointer is implicitly passed to <code>do_display</code>. When the non<code>const</code> version of <code>display</code> calls <code>do_display</code>, its <code>this</code> pointer is implicitly converted from a pointer to non<code>const</code> to a pointer to <code>const</code> (§ <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1178431">4.11.2</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1178431">162</a>).</p>
<p>When <code>do_display</code> completes, the <code>display</code> functions each return the object on which they execute by dereferencing <code>this</code>. In the non<code>const</code> version, <code>this</code> points to a non<code>const</code> object, so that version of <code>display</code> returns an ordinary (non<code>const</code>) reference; the <code>const</code> member returns a reference to <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>When we call <code>display</code> on an object, whether that object is <code>const</code> determines which version of <code>display</code> is called:</p>

```c++
Screen myScreen(5,3);
const Screen blank(5, 3);
myScreen.set('#').display(cout);   // calls non const version
blank.display(cout);               // calls const version
```

::: info
<p>Advice: Use Private Utility Functions for Common Code</p>
<p>Some readers might be surprised that we bothered to define a separate <code>do_display</code> operation. After all, the calls to <code>do_display</code> aren’t much simpler than the action done inside <code>do_display</code>. Why bother? We do so for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A general desire to avoid writing the same code in more than one place.</li>
    <li>We expect that the <code>display</code> operation will become more complicated as our class evolves. As the actions involved become more complicated, it makes more obvious sense to write those actions in one place, not two.</li>
    <li>It is likely that we might want to add debugging information to <code>do_display</code> during development that would be eliminated in the final product version of the code. It will be easier to do so if only one definition of <code>do_display</code> needs to be changed to add or remove the debugging code.</li>
    <li>There needn’t be any overhead involved in this extra function call. We defined <code>do_display</code> inside the class body, so it is implicitly <code>inline</code>. Thus, there likely be no run-time overhead associating with calling <code>do_display</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, well-designed C++ programs tend to have lots of small functions such as <code>do_display</code> that are called to do the “real” work of some other set of functions.</p>

<h4 id="filepos1897012">7.3.3. Class Types</h4>
<p>Every class defines a unique type. Two different classes define two different types even if they define the same members. For example:</p>

::: info
<p>Even if two classes have exactly the same member list, they are different types. The members of each class are distinct from the members of any other class (or any other scope).</p>
:::

<p>We can refer to a class type directly, by using the class name as a type name. Alternatively, we can use the class name following the keyword <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code>:</p>

```c++
Sales_data item1;       // default-initialized object of type Sales_data
class Sales_data item1; // equivalent declaration
```

<p>Both methods of referring to a class type are equivalent. The second method is inherited from C and is also valid in C++.</p>
<h5>Class Declarations</h5>
<p>Just as we can declare a function apart from its definition (§ <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1441405">6.1.2</a>, p. <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1441405">206</a>), we can also declare a class without defining it:</p>

```c++
class Screen; // declaration of the Screen class
```

<p><a id="filepos1903482"></a>This declaration, sometimes referred to as a <strong><a href="080-defined_terms.html#filepos2061019" id="filepos1903543">forward declaration</a></strong>, introduces the name <code>Screen</code> into the program and indicates that <code>Screen</code> refers to a class type. After a declaration and before a definition is seen, the type <code>Screen</code> is an <strong><a href="080-defined_terms.html#filepos2062145" id="filepos1903983">incomplete type</a></strong>—it’s known that <code>Screen</code> is a class type but not known what members that type contains.</p>
<p>We can use an incomplete type in only limited ways: We can define pointers or references to such types, and we can declare (but not define) functions that use an incomplete type as a parameter or return type.</p>
<p>A class must be defined—not just declared—before we can write code that creates objects of that type. Otherwise, the compiler does not know how much storage such objects need. Similarly, the class must be defined before a reference or pointer is used to access a member of the type. After all, if the class has not been defined, the compiler can’t know what members the class has.</p>
<p>With one exception that we’ll describe in § <a href="078-7.6._static_class_members.html#filepos2028441">7.6</a> (p. <a href="078-7.6._static_class_members.html#filepos2028441">300</a>), data members can be specified to be of a class type only if the class has been defined. The type must be complete because the compiler needs to know how much storage the data member requires. Because a class is not defined until its class body is complete, a class cannot have data members of its own type. However, a class is considered declared (but not yet defined) as soon as its class name has been seen. Therefore, a class can have data members that are pointers or references to its own type:</p>

```c++
class Link_screen {
    Screen window;
    Link_screen *next;
    Link_screen *prev;
};

<h4 id="filepos1906774">7.3.4. Friendship Revisited</h4>
<p>Our <code>Sales_data</code> class defined three ordinary nonmember functions as friends (§ <a href="074-7.2._access_control_and_encapsulation.html#filepos1841962">7.2.1</a>, p. <a href="074-7.2._access_control_and_encapsulation.html#filepos1841962">269</a>). A class can also make another class its friend or it can declare specific member functions of another (previously defined) class as friends. In addition, a friend function can be defined inside the class body. Such functions are implicitly <code>inline</code>.</p>
<h5>Friendship between Classes</h5>
<p>As an example of class friendship, our <code>Window_mgr</code> class (§ <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1852806">7.3.1</a>, p. <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1852806">274</a>) will have members that will need access to the internal data of the <code>Screen</code> objects it manages. For example, let’s assume that we want to add a member, named <code>clear</code>
<a id="filepos1908079"></a>to <code>Window_mgr</code> that will reset the contents of a particular <code>Screen</code> to all blanks. To do this job, <code>clear</code> needs to access the <code>private</code> data members of <code>Screen</code>. To allow this access, <code>Screen</code> can designate <code>Window_mgr</code> as its friend:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
    // Window_mgr members can access the private parts of class Screen
    friend class Window_mgr;
    // ... rest of the Screen class
};
```

<p>The member functions of a friend class can access all the members, including the non<code>public</code> members, of the class granting friendship. Now that <code>Window_mgr</code> is a friend of <code>Screen</code>, we can write the <code>clear</code> member of <code>Window_mgr</code> as follows:</p>

```c++
class Window_mgr {
public:
    // location ID for each screen on the window
    using ScreenIndex = std::vector<Screen>::size_type;
    // reset the Screen at the given position to all blanks
    void clear(ScreenIndex);
private:
    std::vector<Screen> screens{Screen(24, 80, ' ')};
};
void Window_mgr::clear(ScreenIndex i)
{
    // s is a reference to the Screen we want to clear
    Screen &s = screens[i];
    // reset the contents of that Screen to all blanks
    s.contents = string(s.height * s.width, ' ');
}
```

<p>We start by defining <code>s</code> as a reference to the <code>Screen</code> at position <code>i</code> in the <code>screens vector</code>. We then use the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> members of that <code>Screen</code> to compute anew <code>string</code> that has the appropriate number of blank characters. We assign that string of blanks to the <code>contents</code> member.</p>
<p>If <code>clear</code> were not a friend of <code>Screen</code>, this code would not compile. The <code>clear</code> function would not be allowed to use the <code>height width</code>, or <code>contents</code> members of <code>Screen</code>. Because <code>Screen</code> grants friendship to <code>Window_mgr</code>, all the members of <code>Screen</code> are accessible to the functions in <code>Window_mgr</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that friendship is not transitive. That is, if class <code>Window_mgr</code> has its own friends, those friends have no special access to <code>Screen</code>.</p>

<p>Each class controls which classes or functions are its friends.</p>

<h5>Making A Member Function a Friend</h5>
<p>Rather than making the entire <code>Window_mgr</code> class a friend, <code>Screen</code> can instead specify that only the <code>clear</code> member is allowed access. When we declare a member function to be a friend, we must specify the class of which that function is a member:</p>
<p><a id="filepos1915600"></a></p>

```c++
class Screen {
    // Window_mgr::clear must have been declared before class Screen
    friend void Window_mgr::clear(ScreenIndex);
    // ... rest of the Screen class
};
```

<p>Making a member function a friend requires careful structuring of our programs to accommodate interdependencies among the declarations and definitions. In this example, we must order our program as follows:</p>
<ul><li>First, define the <code>Window_mgr</code> class, which declares, but cannot define, <code>clear. Screen</code> must be declared before <code>clear</code> can use the members of <code>Screen</code>.</li><li>Next, define class <code>Screen</code>, including a friend declaration for <code>clear</code>.</li><li>Finally, define <code>clear</code>, which can now refer to the members in <code>Screen</code>.</li></ul>

<h5>Overloaded Functions and Friendship</h5>
<p>Although overloaded functions share a common name, they are still different functions. Therefore, a class must declare as a friend each function in a set of overloaded functions that it wishes to make a friend:</p>

```c++
// overloaded storeOn functions
extern std::ostream& storeOn(std::ostream &, Screen &);
extern BitMap& storeOn(BitMap &, Screen &);
class Screen {
    // ostream version of storeOn may access the private parts of Screen objects
    friend std::ostream& storeOn(std::ostream &, Screen &);
    // . . .
};
```

<p>Class <code>Screen</code> makes the version of <code>storeOn</code> that takes an <code>ostream&amp;</code> its friend. The version that takes a <code>BitMap&amp;</code> has no special access to <code>Screen</code>.</p>
<h5>Friend Declarations and Scope</h5>
<p>Classes and nonmember functions need not have been declared before they are used in a friend declaration. When a name first appears in a friend declaration, that name is implicitly <em>assumed</em> to be part of the surrounding scope. However, the friend itself is not actually declared in that scope (§ <a href="074-7.2._access_control_and_encapsulation.html#filepos1841962">7.2.1</a>, p. <a href="074-7.2._access_control_and_encapsulation.html#filepos1841962">270</a>).</p>
<p>Even if we define the function inside the class, we must still provide a declaration outside of the class itself to make that function visible. A declaration must exist even if we only call the friend from members of the friendship granting class:</p>

```c++
struct X {
    friend void f() { /* friend function can be defined in the class body   */ }
    X() { f(); } // error: no declaration for f
    void g();
    void h();
};
void X::g() { return f(); } // error: f hasn't been declared
void f();                   // declares the function defined inside X
void X::h() { return f(); } // ok: declaration for f is now in scope
```

<p>It is important to understand that a friend declaration affects access but is not a declaration in an ordinary sense.</p>

<p>Remember, some compilers do not enforce the lookup rules for friends (§ <a href="074-7.2._access_control_and_encapsulation.html#filepos1841962">7.2.1</a>, p. <a href="074-7.2._access_control_and_encapsulation.html#filepos1841962">270</a>).</p>

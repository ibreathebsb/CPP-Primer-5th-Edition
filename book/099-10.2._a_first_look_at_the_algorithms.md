<h3 id="filepos2472467">10.2. A First Look at the Algorithms</h3>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>The library provides more than 100 algorithms. Fortunately, like the containers, the algorithms have a consistent architecture. Understanding this architecture makes learning and using the algorithms easier than memorizing all 100+ of them. In this chapter, we’ll illustrate how to use the algorithms, and describe the unifying principles that characterize them. <a href="187-appendix_a._the_library.html#filepos5411866">Appendix A</a> lists all the algorithms classified by how they operate.</p>
<p>With only a few exceptions, the algorithms operate over a range of elements. We’ll refer to this range as the “input range.” The algorithms that take an input range always use their first two parameters to denote that range. These parameters are iterators denoting the first and one past the last elements to process.</p>
<p>Although most algorithms are similar in that they operate over an input range, they differ in how they use the elements in that range. The most basic way to understand the algorithms is to know whether they read elements, write elements, or rearrange the order of the elements.</p>
<h4 id="filepos2473899"><a id="filepos2473932"></a>10.2.1. Read-Only Algorithms</h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>A number of the algorithms read, but never write to, the elements in their input range. The <code>find</code> function is one such algorithm, as is the <code>count</code> function we used in the exercises for § <a href="098-10.1._overview.html#filepos2458324">10.1</a> (p. <a href="098-10.1._overview.html#filepos2458324">378</a>).</p>
<p>Another read-only algorithm is <code>accumulate</code>, which is defined in the <code>numeric</code> header. The <code>accumulate</code> function takes three arguments. The first two specify a range of elements to sum. The third is an initial value for the sum. Assuming <code>vec</code> is a sequence of integers, the following</p>

```c++
// sum the elements in vec starting the summation with the value 0
int sum = accumulate(vec.cbegin(), vec.cend(), 0);
```

<p>sets <code>sum</code> equal to the sum of the elements in <code>vec</code>, using <code>0</code> as the starting point for the summation.</p>

::: info
<p>The type of the third argument to <code>accumulate</code> determines which addition operator is used and is the type that <code>accumulate</code> returns.</p>
:::

<h5>Algorithms and Element Types</h5>
<p>The fact that <code>accumulate</code> uses its third argument as the starting point for the summation has an important implication: It must be possible to add the element type to the type of the sum. That is, the elements in the sequence must match or be convertible to the type of the third argument. In this example, the elements in <code>vec</code> might be <code>int</code>s, or they might be <code>double</code>, or <code>long long</code>, or any other type that can be added to an <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>As another example, because <code>string</code> has a <code>+</code> operator, we can concatenate the elements of a <code>vector</code> of <code>string</code>s by calling <code>accumulate</code>:</p>

```c++
string sum = accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), string(""));
```

<p>This call concatenates each element in <code>v</code> onto a <code>string</code> that starts out as the empty string. Note that we explicitly create a <code>string</code> as the third parameter. Passing the empty string as a string literal would be a compile-time error:</p>

```c++
// error: no + on const char*
string sum = accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), "");
```

<p>Had we passed a string literal, the type of the object used to hold the sum would be <code>const char*</code>. That type determines which <code>+</code> operator is used. Because there is no <code>+</code> operator for type <code>const char*</code>, this call will not compile.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Ordinarily it is best to use <code>cbegin()</code> and <code>cend()</code> (§ <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2212546">9.2.3</a>, p. <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2212546">334</a>) with algorithms that read, but do not write, the elements. However, if you plan to use the iterator returned by the algorithm to change an element’s value, then you need to pass <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code>.</p>
:::

<h5><a id="filepos2481142"></a>Algorithms That Operate on Two Sequences</h5>
<Badge type="warning" text="Tricky" />
<p>Another read-only algorithm is <code>equal</code>, which lets us determine whether two sequences hold the same values. It compares each element from the first sequence to the corresponding element in the second. It returns <code>true</code> if the corresponding elements are equal, <code>false</code> otherwise. The algorithm takes three iterators: The first two (as usual) denote the range of elements in the first sequence; the third denotes the first element in the second sequence:</p>

```c++
// roster2 should have at least as many elements as roster1
equal(roster1.cbegin(), roster1.cend(), roster2.cbegin());
```

<p>Because <code>equal</code> operates in terms of iterators, we can call <code>equal</code> to compare elements in containers of different types. Moreover, the element types also need not be the same so long as we can use <code>==</code> to compare the element types. For example, <code>roster1</code> could be a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> and <code>roster2</code> a <code>list&lt;const char*&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>However, <code>equal</code> makes one critically important assumption: It assumes that the second sequence is at least as big as the first. This algorithm potentially looks at every element in the first sequence. It assumes that there is a corresponding element for each of those elements in the second sequence.</p>

<p>Algorithms that take a single iterator denoting a second sequence <em>assume</em> that the second sequence is at least as large at the first.</p>

<h4 id="filepos2485637">10.2.2. Algorithms That Write Container Elements</h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>Some algorithms assign new values to the elements in a sequence. When we use an algorithm that assigns to elements, we must take care to ensure that the sequence into which the algorithm writes is at least as large as the number of elements we ask the algorithm to write. Remember, algorithms do not perform container operations, so they have no way themselves to change the size of a container.</p>
<p>Some algorithms write to elements in the input range itself. These algorithms are not inherently dangerous because they write only as many elements as are in the specified range.</p>
<p>As one example, the <code>fill</code> algorithm takes a pair of iterators that denote a range and a third argument that is a value. <code>fill</code> assigns the given value to each element in the input sequence:</p>

::: info
<a id="filepos2486948"></a><p>Key Concept: Iterator Arguments</p>
<p>Some algorithms read elements from two sequences. The elements that constitute these sequences can be stored in different kinds of containers. For example, the first sequence might be stored in a <code>vector</code> and the second might be in a <code>list</code>, a <code>deque</code>, a built-in array, or some other sequence. Moreover, the element types in the two sequences are not required to match exactly. What is required is that we be able to compare elements from the two sequences. For example, in the <code>equal</code> algorithm, the element types need not be identical, but we do have to be able to use <code>==</code> to compare elements from the two sequences.</p>
<p>Algorithms that operate on two sequences differ as to how we pass the second sequence. Some algorithms, such as <code>equal</code>, take three iterators: The first two denote the range of the first sequence, and the third iterator denotes the first element in the second sequence. Others take four iterators: The first two denote the range of elements in the first sequence, and the second two denote the range for the second sequence.</p>
<p>Algorithms that use a single iterator to denote the second sequence <em>assume</em> that the second sequence is at least as large as the first. It is up to us to ensure that the algorithm will not attempt to access a nonexistent element in the second sequence. For example, the <code>equal</code> algorithm potentially compares every element from its first sequence to an element in the second. If the second sequence is a subset of the first, then our program has a serious error—<code>equal</code> will attempt to access elements beyond the end of the second sequence.</p>
:::

```c++
fill(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 0);  // reset each element to 0
// set a subsequence of the container to 10
fill(vec.begin(), vec.begin() + vec.size()/2, 10);
```

<p>Because <code>fill</code> writes to its given input sequence, so long as we pass a valid input sequence, the writes will be safe.</p>
<h5>Algorithms Do Not Check Write Operations</h5>
<Badge type="warning" text="Tricky" />
<p>Some algorithms take an iterator that denotes a separate destination. These algorithms assign new values to the elements of a sequence starting at the element denoted by the destination iterator. For example, the <code>fill_n</code> function takes a single iterator, a count, and a value. It assigns the given value to the specified number of elements starting at the element denoted to by the iterator. We might use <code>fill_n</code> to assign a new value to the elements in a <code>vector</code>:</p>

```c++
vector<int> vec;  // empty vector
// use vec giving it various values
fill_n(vec.begin(), vec.size(), 0); // reset all the elements of vec to 0
```

<p>The <code>fill_n</code> function assumes that it is safe to write the specified number of elements. That is, for a call of the form</p>

```c++
fill_n(dest, n, val)
```

<p><code>fill_n</code> assumes that <code>dest</code> refers to an element and that there are at least <code>n</code> elements in the sequence starting from <code>dest</code>.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2493305"></a>It is a fairly common beginner mistake to call <code>fill_n</code> (or similar algorithms that write to elements) on a container that has no elements:</p>

```c++
vector<int> vec;  // empty vector
// disaster: attempts to write to ten (nonexistent) elements in vec
fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0);
```

<p>This call to <code>fill_n</code> is a disaster. We specified that ten elements should be written, but there are no such elements—<code>vec</code> is empty. The result is undefined.</p>

::: warning
<p>Algorithms that write to a destination iterator <em>assume</em> the destination is large enough to hold the number of elements being written.</p>
:::

<h5>Introducing <code>back_inserter</code></h5>
<p>One way to ensure that an algorithm has enough elements to hold the output is to use an <strong><a href="105-defined_terms.html#filepos2713270" id="filepos2495420">insert iterator</a></strong>. An insert iterator is an iterator that <em>adds</em> elements to a container. Ordinarily, when we assign to a container element through an iterator, we assign to the element that iterator denotes. When we assign through an insert iterator, a new element equal to the right-hand value is added to the container.</p>
<p>We’ll have more to say about insert iterators in § <a href="101-10.4._revisiting_iterators.html#filepos2619592">10.4.1</a> (p. <a href="101-10.4._revisiting_iterators.html#filepos2619592">401</a>). However, in order to illustrate how to use algorithms that write to a container, we will use <code>back_inserter</code>, which is a function defined in the <code>iterator</code> header.</p>
<p><code>back_inserter</code> takes a reference to a container and returns an insert iterator bound to that container. When we assign through that iterator, the assignment calls <code>push_back</code> to add an element with the given value to the container:</p>

```c++
vector<int> vec; // empty vector
auto it = back_inserter(vec); // assigning through it adds elements to vec
*it = 42;        // vec now has one element with value 42
```

<p>We frequently use <code>back_inserter</code> to create an iterator to use as the destination of an algorithm. For example:</p>

```c++
vector<int> vec; // empty vector
// ok: back_inserter creates an insert iterator that adds elements to vec
fill_n(back_inserter(vec), 10, 0);  // appends ten elements to vec
```

<p>On each iteration, <code>fill_n</code> assigns to an element in the given sequence. Because we passed an iterator returned by <code>back_inserter</code>, each assignment will call <code>push_back</code> on <code>vec</code>. As a result, this call to <code>fill_n</code> adds ten elements to the end of <code>vec</code>, each of which has the value <code>0</code>.</p>
<h5>Copy Algorithms</h5>
<p>The <code>copy</code> algorithm is another example of an algorithm that writes to the elements of an output sequence denoted by a destination iterator. This algorithm takes three iterators. The first two denote an input range; the third denotes the beginning of the destination sequence. This algorithm copies elements from its input range into elements in the destination. It is essential that the destination passed to <code>copy</code> be at least as large as the input range.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2500853"></a>As one example, we can use <code>copy</code> to copy one built-in array to another:</p>

```c++
int a1[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
int a2[sizeof(a1)/sizeof(*a1)];  // a2 has the same size as a1
// ret points just past the last element copied into a2
auto ret = copy(begin(a1), end(a1), a2);  // copy a1 into a2
```

<p>Here we define an array named <code>a2</code> and use <code>sizeof</code> to ensure that <code>a2</code> has as many elements as the array <code>a1</code> (§ <a href="047-4.9._the_sizeof_operator.html#filepos1142429">4.9</a>, p. <a href="047-4.9._the_sizeof_operator.html#filepos1142429">157</a>). We then call <code>copy</code> to copy <code>a1</code> into <code>a2</code>. After the call to <code>copy</code>, the elements in both arrays have the same values.</p>
<p>The value returned by <code>copy</code> is the (incremented) value of its destination iterator. That is, <code>ret</code> will point just past the last element copied into <code>a2</code>.</p>
<p>Several algorithms provide so-called “copying” versions. These algorithms compute new element values, but instead of putting them back into their input sequence, the algorithms create a new sequence to contain the results.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>replace</code> algorithm reads a sequence and replaces every instance of a given value with another value. This algorithm takes four parameters: two iterators denoting the input range, and two values. It replaces each element that is equal to the first value with the second:</p>

```c++
// replace any element with the value 0 with 42
replace(ilst.begin(), ilst.end(), 0, 42);
```

<p>This call replaces all instances of <code>0</code> by <code>42</code>. If we want to leave the original sequence unchanged, we can call <code>replace_copy</code>. That algorithm takes a third iterator argument denoting a destination in which to write the adjusted sequence:</p>

```c++
// use back_inserter to grow destination as needed
replace_copy(ilst.cbegin(), ilst.cend(),
             back_inserter(ivec), 0, 42);
```

<p>After this call, <code>ilst</code> is unchanged, and <code>ivec</code> contains a copy of <code>ilst</code> with the exception that every element in <code>ilst</code> with the value 0 has the value 42 in <code>ivec</code>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos2506543">10.2.3. Algorithms That Reorder Container Elements</h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>Some algorithms rearrange the order of elements within a container. An obvious example of such an algorithm is <code>sort</code>. A call to <code>sort</code> arranges the elements in the input range into sorted order using the element type’s <code>&lt;</code> operator.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose we want to analyze the words used in a set of children’s stories. We’ll assume that we have a <code>vector</code> that holds the text of several stories. We’d like to reduce this <code>vector</code> so that each word appears only once, regardless of how many times that word appears in any of the given stories.</p>
<p>For purposes of illustration, we’ll use the following simple story as our input:</p>

```
the quick red fox jumps over the slow red turtle
```

<p>Given this input, our program should produce the following <code>vector</code>:</p>

| fox | jumps | over | quick | red | slow | the | turtle |
|-----|-------|------|-------|-----|------|-----|--------|

<p><strong>(a)</strong></p>

 fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0);
```

<p><strong>Exercise 10.8:</strong> We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they operate. Why doesn’t the use of <code>back_inserter</code> invalidate this claim?</p>
:::

<h5>Eliminating Duplicates</h5>
<p>To eliminate the duplicated words, we will first sort the <code>vector</code> so that duplicated words appear adjacent to each other. Once the <code>vector</code> is sorted, we can use another library algorithm, named <code>unique</code>, to reorder the <code>vector</code> so that the unique elements appear in the first part of the <code>vector</code>. Because algorithms cannot do container operations, we’ll use the <code>erase</code> member of <code>vector</code> to actually remove the elements:</p>

```c++
void elimDups(vector<string> &words)
{
    // sort words alphabetically so we can find the duplicates
    sort(words.begin(), words.end());
    // unique  reorders the input range so that each word appears once in the
    // front portion of the range and returns an iterator one past the unique range
    auto end_unique = unique(words.begin(), words.end());
    // erase uses a vector operation to remove the nonunique elements
    words.erase(end_unique, words.end());
}
```

<p>The <code>sort</code> algorithm takes two iterators denoting the range of elements to sort. In this call, we sort the entire <code>vector</code>. After the call to <code>sort, words</code> is ordered as</p>

| fox | jumps | over | quick | red | red | slow | the | the | turtle |
|-----|-------|------|-------|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|--------|

<p>Note that the words <code>red</code> and <code>the</code> appear twice.</p>
<h5>Using <code>unique</code></h5>
<Badge type="warning" text="Tricky" />
<p>Once <code>words</code> is sorted, we want to keep only one copy of each word. The <code>unique</code> algorithm rearranges the input range to “eliminate” adjacent duplicated entries, <a id="filepos2514857"></a>and returns an iterator that denotes the end of the range of the unique values. After the call to <code>unique</code>, the <code>vector</code> holds</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00070.jpg"/>
<p>The size of <code>words</code> is unchanged; it still has ten elements. The order of those elements is changed—the adjacent duplicates have been “removed.” We put remove in quotes because <code>unique</code> doesn’t remove any elements. Instead, it overwrites adjacent duplicates so that the unique elements appear at the front of the sequence. The iterator returned by <code>unique</code> denotes one past the last unique element. The elements beyond that point still exist, but we don’t know what values they have.</p>

::: info
<p>The library algorithms operate on iterators, not containers. Therefore, an algorithm cannot (directly) add or remove elements.</p>
:::

<h5>Using Container Operations to Remove Elements</h5>
<Badge type="warning" text="Tricky" />
<p>To actually remove the unused elements, we must use a container operation, which we do in the call to <code>erase</code> (§ <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2306887">9.3.3</a>, p. <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2306887">349</a>). We erase the range of elements from the one to which <code>end_unique</code> refers through the end of <code>words</code>. After this call, <code>words</code> contains the eight unique words from the input.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this call to <code>erase</code> would be safe even if <code>words</code> has no duplicated words. In that case, <code>unique</code> would return <code>words.end()</code>. Both arguments to <code>erase</code> would have the same value: <code>words.end()</code>. The fact that the iterators are equal would mean that the range passed to <code>erase</code> would be empty. Erasing an empty range has no effect, so our program is correct even if the input has no duplicates.</p>

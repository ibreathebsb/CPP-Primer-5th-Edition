<h3 id="filepos462256">2.4. <code>const</code> Qualifier</h3>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>Sometimes we want to define a variable whose value we know cannot be changed. For example, we might want to use a variable to refer to the size of a buffer size. Using a variable makes it easy for us to change the size of the buffer if we decided the original size wasn’t what we needed. On the other hand, we’d also like to prevent code from inadvertently giving a new value to the variable we use to represent the buffer size. We can make a variable unchangeable by defining the variable’s type as <code>const</code>:</p>

```c++
const int bufSize = 512;    // input buffer size
```

<p>defines <code>bufSize</code> as a constant. Any attempt to assign to <code>bufSize</code> is an error:</p>

```c++
bufSize = 512; // error: attempt to write to const object
```

<p>Because we can’t change the value of a <code>const</code> object after we create it, it must be initialized. As usual, the initializer may be an arbitrarily complicated expression:</p>

```c++
const int i = get_size();  // ok: initialized at run time
const int j = 42;          // ok: initialized at compile time
const int k;               // error: k is uninitialized const
```

<h4>Initialization and <code>const</code></h4>
<p>As we have observed many times, the type of an object defines the operations that can be performed by that object. A <code>const</code> type can use most but not all of the same operations as its non<code>const</code> version. The one restriction is that we may use only those operations that cannot change an object. So, for example, we can use a <code>const int</code> in arithmetic expressions in exactly the same way as a plain, non<code>const int</code>. A <code>const int</code> converts to <code>bool</code> the same way as a plain <code>int</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Among the operations that don’t change the value of an object is initialization—when we use an object to initialize another object, it doesn’t matter whether either or both of the objects are <code>const</code>s:</p>

```c++
int i = 42;
const int ci = i;    // ok: the value in i is copied into ci
int j = ci;          // ok: the value in ci is copied into j
```

<p>Although <code>ci</code> is a <code>const int</code>, the value in <code>ci</code> is an <code>int</code>. The <code>const</code>ness of <code>ci</code> matters only for operations that might change <code>ci</code>. When we copy <code>ci</code> to initialize <code>j</code>, we don’t care that <code>ci</code> is a <code>const</code>. Copying an object doesn’t change that object. Once the copy is made, the new object has no further access to the original object.</p>
<h4><a id="filepos469506"></a>By Default, <code>const</code> Objects Are Local to a File</h4>
<p>When a <code>const</code> object is initialized from a compile-time constant, such as in our definition of <code>bufSize</code>:</p>

```c++
const int bufSize = 512;    // input buffer size
```

<p>the compiler will usually replace uses of the variable with its corresponding value during compilation. That is, the compiler will generate code using the value <code>512</code> in the places that our code uses <code>bufSize</code>.</p>
<p>To substitute the value for the variable, the compiler has to see the variable’s initializer. When we split a program into multiple files, every file that uses the <code>const</code> must have access to its initializer. In order to see the initializer, the variable must be defined in every file that wants to use the variable’s value (§ <a href="022-2.2._variables.html#filepos368323">2.2.2</a>, p. <a href="022-2.2._variables.html#filepos368323">45</a>). To support this usage, yet avoid multiple definitions of the same variable, <code>const</code> variables are defined as local to the file. When we define a <code>const</code> with the same name in multiple files, it is as if we had written definitions for separate variables in each file.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have a <code>const</code> variable that we want to share across multiple files but whose initializer is not a constant expression. In this case, we don’t want the compiler to generate a separate variable in each file. Instead, we want the <code>const</code> object to behave like other (non<code>const</code>) variables. We want to define the <code>const</code> in one file, and declare it in the other files that use that object.</p>
<p>To define a single instance of a <code>const</code> variable, we use the keyword <code>extern</code> on both its definition and declaration(s):</p>

```c++
// file_1.cc defines and initializes a const that is accessible to other files
extern const int bufSize = fcn();
// file_1.h
extern const int bufSize; // same bufSize as defined in file_1.cc
```

<p>In this program, <code>file_1.cc</code> defines and initializes <code>bufSize</code>. Because this declaration includes an initializer, it is (as usual) a definition. However, because <code>bufSize</code> is <code>const</code>, we must specify <code>extern</code> in order for <code>bufSize</code> to be used in other files.</p>
<p>The declaration in <code>file_1.h</code> is also <code>extern</code>. In this case, the <code>extern</code> signifies that <code>bufSize</code> is not local to this file and that its definition will occur elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="filepos476737"><a id="filepos476770"></a>2.4.1. References to <code>const</code></h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>As with any other object, we can bind a reference to an object of a <code>const</code> type. To do so we use a <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos624795" id="filepos477231">reference to <code>const</code></a></strong>, which is a reference that refers to a <code>const</code> type. Unlike an ordinary reference, a reference to <code>const</code> cannot be used to change the object to which the reference is bound:</p>

```c++
const int ci = 1024;
const int &r1 = ci;   // ok: both reference and underlying object are const
r1 = 42;              // error: r1 is a reference to const
int &r2 = ci;         // error: non const reference to a const object
```

<p>Because we cannot assign directly to <code>ci</code>, we also should not be able to use a reference to change <code>ci</code>. Therefore, the initialization of <code>r2</code> is an error. If this initialization were legal, we could use <code>r2</code> to change the value of its underlying object.</p>

::: info
<p>Terminology: <code>const</code> Reference is a Reference to <code>const</code></p>
<p>C++ programmers tend to abbreviate the phrase “reference to <code>const</code>” as “<code>const</code> reference.” This abbreviation makes sense—if you remember that it is an abbreviation.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, there are no <code>const</code> references. A reference is not an object, so we cannot make a reference itself <code>const</code>. Indeed, because there is no way to make a reference refer to a different object, in some sense all references are <code>const</code>. Whether a reference refers to a <code>const</code> or non<code>const</code> type affects what we can do with that reference, not whether we can alter the binding of the reference itself.</p>
:::

<h5>Initialization and References to <code>const</code></h5>
<p>In § <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos396246">2.3.1</a> (p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos396246">51</a>) we noted that there are two exceptions to the rule that the type of a reference must match the type of the object to which it refers. The first exception is that we can initialize a reference to <code>const</code> from any expression that can be converted (§ <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos304094">2.1.2</a>, p. <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos304094">35</a>) to the type of the reference. In particular, we can bind a reference to <code>const</code> to a non<code>const</code> object, a literal, or a more general expression:</p>

```c++
int i = 42;
const int &r1 = i;      // we can bind a const int& to a plain int object
const int &r2 = 42;     // ok: r1 is a reference to const
const int &r3 = r1 * 2; // ok: r3 is a reference to const
int &r4 = r * 2;        // error: r4 is a plain, non const reference
```

<p>The easiest way to understand this difference in initialization rules is to consider what happens when we bind a reference to an object of a different type:</p>

```c++
double dval = 3.14;
const int &ri = dval;
```

<p>Here <code>ri</code> refers to an <code>int</code>. Operations on <code>ri</code> will be integer operations, but <code>dval</code> is a floating-point number, not an integer. To ensure that the object to which <code>ri</code> is bound is an <code>int</code>, the compiler transforms this code into something like</p>
<p><a id="filepos485357"></a></p>

```c++
const int temp = dval;   // create a temporary const int from the double
const int &ri = temp;    // bind ri to that temporary
```

<p>In this case, <code>ri</code> is bound to a <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos627457" id="filepos486375">temporary</a></strong> object. A temporary object is an unnamed object created by the compiler when it needs a place to store a result from evaluating an expression. C++ programmers often use the word temporary as an abbreviation for temporary object.</p>
<p>Now consider what could happen if this initialization were allowed but <code>ri</code> was not <code>const</code>. If <code>ri</code> weren’t <code>const</code>, we could assign to <code>ri</code>. Doing so would change the object to which <code>ri</code> is bound. That object is a temporary, not <code>dval</code>. The programmer who made <code>ri</code> refer to <code>dval</code> would probably expect that assigning to <code>ri</code> would change <code>dval</code>. After all, why assign to <code>ri</code> unless the intent is to change the object to which <code>ri</code> is bound? Because binding a reference to a temporary is almost surely <em>not</em> what the programmer intended, the language makes it illegal.</p>
<h5>A Reference to <code>const</code> May Refer to an Object That Is Not <code>const</code></h5>
<p>It is important to realize that a reference to <code>const</code> restricts only what we can do through that reference. Binding a reference to <code>const</code> to an object says nothing about whether the underlying object itself is <code>const</code>. Because the underlying object might be non<code>const</code>, it might be changed by other means:</p>

```c++
int i = 42;
int &r1 = i;          // r1 bound to i
const int &r2 = i;    // r2 also bound to i; but cannot be used to change i
r1 = 0;               // r1 is not const; i is now 0
r2 = 0;               // error: r2 is a reference to const
```

<p>Binding <code>r2</code> to the (non<code>const</code>) <code>int i</code> is legal. However, we cannot use <code>r2</code> to change <code>i</code>. Even so, the value in <code>i</code> still might change. We can change <code>i</code> by assigning to it directly, or by assigning to another reference bound to <code>i</code>, such as <code>r1</code>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos491891">2.4.2. Pointers and <code>const</code></h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>As with references, we can define pointers that point to either <code>const</code> or non<code>const</code> types. Like a reference to <code>const</code>, a <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos623589" id="filepos492522">pointer to <code>const</code></a></strong> (§ <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos476737">2.4.1</a>, p. <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos476737">61</a>) may not be used to change the object to which the pointer points. We may store the address of a <code>const</code> object only in a pointer to <code>const</code>:</p>

```c++
const double pi = 3.14;   // pi is const; its value may not be changed
double *ptr = &pi;        // error: ptr is a plain pointer
const double *cptr = &pi; // ok: cptr may point to a double that is const
*cptr = 42;               // error: cannot assign to *cptr
```

<p>In § <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">2.3.2</a> (p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">52</a>) we noted that there are two exceptions to the rule that the types of a pointer and the object to which it points must match. The first exception is that we can use a pointer to <code>const</code> to point to a non<code>const</code> object:</p>

```c++
double dval = 3.14;       // dval is a double; its value can be changed
cptr = &dval;             // ok: but can't change dval through cptr
```

<p><a id="filepos496349"></a>Like a reference to <code>const</code>, a pointer to <code>const</code> says nothing about whether the object to which the pointer points is <code>const</code>. Defining a pointer as a pointer to <code>const</code> affects only what we can do with the pointer. It is important to remember that there is no guarantee that an object pointed to by a pointer to <code>const</code> won’t change.</p>

::: tip
<p>It may be helpful to think of pointers and references to <code>const</code> as pointers or references “that <em>think</em> they point or refer to <code>const</code>.”</p>
:::

<h5><code>const</code> Pointers</h5>
<p>Unlike references, pointers are objects. Hence, as with any other object type, we can have a pointer that is itself <code>const</code>. Like any other <code>const</code> object, a <code>const</code>
<strong>pointer</strong> must be initialized, and once initialized, its value (i.e., the address that it holds) may not be changed. We indicate that the pointer is <code>const</code> by putting the <code>const</code> after the <code>*</code>. This placement indicates that it is the pointer, not the pointed-to type, that is <code>const</code>:</p>

```c++
int errNumb = 0;
int *const curErr = &errNumb;  // curErr will always point to errNumb
const double pi = 3.14159;
const double *const pip = &pi; // pip is a const pointer to a const object
```

<p>As we saw in § <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos445809">2.3.3</a> (p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos445809">58</a>), the easiest way to understand these declarations is to read them from right to left. In this case, the symbol closest to <code>curErr</code> is <code>const</code>, which means that <code>curErr</code> itself will be a <code>const</code> object. The type of that object is formed from the rest of the declarator. The next symbol in the declarator is <code>*</code>, which means that <code>curErr</code> is a <code>const</code> pointer. Finally, the base type of the declaration completes the type of <code>curErr</code>, which is a <code>const</code> pointer to an object of type <code>int</code>. Similarly, <code>pip</code> is a <code>const</code> pointer to an object of type <code>const double</code>.</p>
<p>The fact that a pointer is itself <code>const</code> says nothing about whether we can use the pointer to change the underlying object. Whether we can change that object depends entirely on the type to which the pointer points. For example, <code>pip</code> is a <code>const</code> pointer to <code>const</code>. Neither the value of the object addressed by <code>pip</code> nor the address stored in <code>pip</code> can be changed. On the other hand, <code>curErr</code> addresses a plain, non<code>const int</code>. We can use <code>curErr</code> to change the value of <code>errNumb</code>:</p>

```c++
*pip = 2.72;     // error: pip is a pointer to const
// if the object to which curErr points (i.e., errNumb) is nonzero
if (*curErr) {
    errorHandler();
    *curErr = 0; // ok: reset the value of the object to which curErr is bound
}
```

:::

<p>More generally, top-level <code>const</code> indicates that an object itself is <code>const</code>. Top-level <code>const</code> can appear in any object type, i.e., one of the built-in arithmetic types, a class type, or a pointer type. Low-level <code>const</code> appears in the base type of compound types such as pointers or references. Note that pointer types, unlike most other types, can have both top-level and low-level <code>const</code> independently:</p>

```c++
int i = 0;
int *const p1 = &i;  // we can't change the value of p1; const is top-level
const int ci = 42;   // we cannot change ci; const is top-level
const int *p2 = &ci; // we can change p2; const is low-level
const int *const p3 = p2; // right-most const is top-level, left-most is not
const int &r = ci;  // const in reference types is always low-level
```

<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>The distinction between top-level and low-level matters when we copy an object. When we copy an object, top-level <code>const</code>s are ignored:</p>

```c++
i = ci;  // ok: copying the value of ci; top-level const in ci is ignored
p2 = p3; // ok: pointed-to type matches; top-level const in p3 is ignored
```

<p>Copying an object doesn’t change the copied object. As a result, it is immaterial whether the object copied from or copied into is <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, low-level <code>const</code> is never ignored. When we copy an object, both objects must have the same low-level <code>const</code> qualification or there must be a conversion between the types of the two objects. In general, we can convert a non<code>const</code> to <code>const</code> but not the other way round:</p>
<p><a id="filepos514745"></a></p>

```c++
int *p = p3; // error: p3 has a low-level const but p doesn't
p2 = p3;     // ok: p2 has the same low-level const qualification as p3
p2 = &i;     // ok: we can convert int* to const int*
int &r = ci; // error: can't bind an ordinary int& to a const int object
const int &r2 = i; // ok: can bind const int& to plain int
```

<p><code>p3</code> has both a top-level and low-level <code>const</code>. When we copy <code>p3</code>, we can ignore its top-level <code>const</code> but not the fact that it points to a <code>const</code> type. Hence, we cannot use <code>p3</code> to initialize <code>p</code>, which points to a plain (non<code>const</code>) <code>int</code>. On the other hand, we can assign <code>p3</code> to <code>p2</code>. Both pointers have the same (low-level <code>const</code>) type. The fact that <code>p3</code> is a <code>const</code> pointer (i.e., that it has a top-level <code>const</code>) doesn’t matter.</p>

<h4 id="filepos520427">2.4.4. <code>constexpr</code> and Constant Expressions</h4>
<Badge type="danger" text="Advanced" />
<p>A <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos615363" id="filepos520769">constant expression</a></strong> is an expression whose value cannot change and that can be evaluated at compile time. A literal is a constant expression. A <code>const</code> object that is initialized from a constant expression is also a constant expression. As we’ll see, there are several contexts in the language that require constant expressions.</p>
<p>Whether a given object (or expression) is a constant expression depends on the types and the initializers. For example:</p>

```c++
const int max_files = 20;    // max_files is a constant expression
const int limit = max_files + 1; // limit is a constant expression
int staff_size = 27;       // staff_size is not a constant expression
const int sz = get_size(); // sz is not a constant expression
```

<p>Although <code>staff_size</code> is initialized from a literal, it is not a constant expression because it is a plain <code>int</code>, not a <code>const int</code>. On the other hand, even though <code>sz</code> is a <code>const</code>, the value of its initializer is not known until run time. Hence, <code>sz</code> is not a constant expression.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos523317"></a><code>constexpr</code> Variables</h5>
<p>In a large system, it can be difficult to determine (for certain) that an initializer is a constant expression. We might define a <code>const</code> variable with an initializer that we think is a constant expression. However, when we use that variable in a context that requires a constant expression we may discover that the initializer was not a constant expression. In general, the definition of an object and its use in such a context can be widely separated.</p>
<a id="filepos524101"></a><Badge type="tip" text="C++11" />
<p>Under the new standard, we can ask the compiler to verify that a variable is a constant expression by declaring the variable in a <code>constexpr</code> declaration. Variables declared as <code>constexpr</code> are implicitly <code>const</code> and must be initialized by constant expressions:</p>

```c++
constexpr int mf = 20;        // 20 is a constant expression
constexpr int limit = mf + 1; // mf + 1 is a constant expression
constexpr int sz = size();    // ok only if size is a constexpr function
```

<p>Although we cannot use an ordinary function as an initializer for a <code>constexpr</code> variable, we’ll see in § <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">6.5.2</a> (p. <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">239</a>) that the new standard lets us define certain functions as <code>constexpr</code>. Such functions must be simple enough that the compiler can evaluate them at compile time. We can use <code>constexpr</code> functions in the initializer of a <code>constexpr</code> variable.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Generally, it is a good idea to use <code>constexpr</code> for variables that you intend to use as constant expressions.</p>
:::

<h5>Literal Types</h5>
<p>Because a constant expression is one that can be evaluated at compile time, there are limits on the types that we can use in a <code>constexpr</code> declaration. The types we can use in a <code>constexpr</code> are known as “literal types” because they are simple enough to have literal values.</p>
<p>Of the types we have used so far, the arithmetic, reference, and pointer types are literal types. Our <code>Sales_item</code> class and the library IO and <code>string</code> types are not literal types. Hence, we cannot define variables of these types as <code>constexpr</code>s. We’ll see other kinds of literal types in § <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos2019288">7.5.6</a> (p. <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos2019288">299</a>) and § <a href="179-19.3._enumerations.html#filepos5202480">19.3</a> (p. <a href="179-19.3._enumerations.html#filepos5202480">832</a>).</p>
<p>Although we can define both pointers and reference as <code>constexpr</code>s, the objects we use to initialize them are strictly limited. We can initialize a <code>constexpr</code> pointer from the <code>nullptr</code> literal or the literal (i.e., constant expression) <code>0</code>. We can also point to (or bind to) an object that remains at a fixed address.</p>
<p>For reasons we’ll cover in § <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1431793">6.1.1</a> (p. <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1431793">204</a>), variables defined inside a function ordinarily are not stored at a fixed address. Hence, we cannot use a <code>constexpr</code> pointer to point to such variables. On the other hand, the address of an object defined outside of any function is a constant expression, and so may be used to initialize a <code>constexpr</code> pointer. We’ll see in § <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1431793">6.1.1</a> (p. <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1431793">205</a>), that functions may define variables that exist across calls to that function. Like an object defined outside any function, these special local objects also have fixed addresses. Therefore, a <code>constexpr</code> reference may be bound to, and a <code>constexpr</code> pointer may address, such variables.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos530182"></a>Pointers and <code>constexpr</code></h5>
<p>It is important to understand that when we define a pointer in a <code>constexpr</code> declaration, the <code>constexpr</code> specifier applies to the pointer, not the type to which the pointer points:</p>

```c++
const int *p = nullptr;     // p is a pointer to a const int
constexpr int *q = nullptr; // q is a const pointer to int
```

<p>Despite appearances, the types of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are quite different; <code>p</code> is a pointer to <code>const</code>, whereas <code>q</code> is a constant pointer. The difference is a consequence of the fact that <code>constexpr</code> imposes a top-level <code>const</code> (§ <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos504024">2.4.3</a>, p. <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos504024">63</a>) on the objects it defines.</p>
<p>Like any other constant pointer, a <code>constexpr</code> pointer may point to a <code>const</code> or a non<code>const</code> type:</p>

```c++
constexpr int *np = nullptr; // np is a constant pointer to int that is null
int j = 0;
constexpr int i = 42;  // type of i is const int
// i and j must be defined outside any function
constexpr const int *p = &i; // p is a constant pointer to the const int i
constexpr int *p1 = &j;      // p1 is a constant pointer to the int j
```

<h3 id="filepos3595833">14.3. Arithmetic and Relational Operators</h3>
<p>Ordinarily, we define the arithmetic and relational operators as nonmember functions in order to allow conversions for either the left- or right-hand operand (§ <a href="130-14.1._basic_concepts.html#filepos3549336">14.1</a>, p. <a href="130-14.1._basic_concepts.html#filepos3549336">555</a>). These operators shouldn’t need to change the state of either operand, so the parameters are ordinarily references to <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>An arithmetic operator usually generates a new value that is the result of a computation on its two operands. That value is distinct from either operand and is calculated in a local variable. The operation returns a copy of this local as its result. Classes that define an arithmetic operator generally define the corresponding compound assignment operator as well. When a class has both operators, it is usually more efficient to define the arithmetic operator to use compound assignment:</p>

```c++
// assumes that both objects refer to the same book
Sales_data
operator+(const Sales_data &lhs, const Sales_data &rhs)
{
    Sales_data sum = lhs;  // copy data members from lhs into sum
    sum += rhs;             // add rhs into sum
    return sum;
}
```

<p>This definition is essentially identical to our original <code>add</code> function (§ <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1792181">7.1.3</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1792181">261</a>). We copy <code>lhs</code> into the local variable <code>sum</code>. We then use the <code>Sales_data</code> compound-assignment operator (which we’ll define on page <a href="133-14.4._assignment_operators.html#filepos3616357">564</a>) to add the values from <code>rhs</code> into <code>sum</code>. We end the function by returning a copy of <code>sum</code>.</p>

<h4 id="filepos3601039">14.3.1. Equality Operators</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Ordinarily, classes in C++ define the equality operator to test whether two objects are equivalent. That is, they usually compare every data member and treat two objects as equal if and only if all the corresponding members are equal. In line with this design philosophy, our <code>Sales_data</code> equality operator should compare the <code>bookNo</code> as well as the sales figures:</p>

```c++
bool operator==(const Sales_data &lhs, const Sales_data &rhs)
{
    return lhs.isbn() == rhs.isbn() &&
           lhs.units_sold == rhs.units_sold &&
           lhs.revenue == rhs.revenue;
}
bool operator!=(const Sales_data &lhs, const Sales_data &rhs)
{
    return !(lhs == rhs);
}
```

<p>The definition of these functions is trivial. More important are the design principles that these functions embody:</p>
<ol><li>Define an ordering relation that is consistent with the requirements for use as a key to an associative container (§ <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2751456">11.2.2</a>, p. <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2751456">424</a>); and</li><li>Define a relation that is consistent with <code>==</code> if the class has both operators.

<h4 id="filepos3607012">14.3.2. Relational Operators</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Classes for which the equality operator is defined also often (but not always) have relational operators. In particular, because the associative containers and some of the algorithms use the less-than operator, it can be useful to define an <code>operator&lt;</code>.</p>
<p>Ordinarily the relational operators should</p>

<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>Although we might think our <code>Sales_data</code> class should support the relational operators, it turns out that it probably should not do so. The reasons are subtle and are worth understanding.</p>
<p>We might think that we’d define <code>&lt;</code> similarly to <code>compareIsbn</code> (§ <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2751456">11.2.2</a>, p. <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2751456">425</a>). That function compared <code>Sales_data</code> objects by comparing their <small>ISBN</small>s. Although <code>compareIsbn</code> provides an ordering relation that meets requirment 1, that function yields results that are inconsistent with our definition of <code>==</code>. As a result, it does not meet requirement 2.</p>
<p>The <code>Sales_data ==</code> operator treats two transactions with the same <small>ISBN</small> as unequal if they have different <code>revenue</code> or <code>units_sold</code> members. If we defined <a id="filepos3609993"></a>the <code>&lt;</code> operator to compare only the <small>ISBN</small> member, then two objects with the same <small>ISBN</small> but different <code>units_sold</code> or <code>revenue</code> would compare as unequal, but neither object would be less than the other. Ordinarily, if we have two objects, neither of which is less than the other, then we expect that those objects are equal.</p>
<p>We might think that we should, therefore, define <code>operator&lt;</code> to compare each data element in turn. We could define <code>operator&lt;</code> to compare objects with equal <code>isbn</code>s by looking next at the <code>units_sold</code> and then at the <code>revenue</code> members.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing essential about this ordering. Depending on how we plan to use the class, we might want to define the order based first on either <code>revenue</code> or <code>units_sold</code>. We might want those objects with fewer <code>units_sold</code> to be “less than” those with more. Or we might want to consider those with smaller <code>revenue</code> “less than” those with more.</p>
<p>For <code>Sales_data</code>, there is no single logical definition of <code>&lt;</code>. Thus, it is better for this class not to define <code>&lt;</code> at all.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>If a single logical definition for <code>&lt;</code> exists, classes usually should define the <code>&lt;</code> operator. However, if the class also has <code>==</code>, define <code>&lt;</code> only if the definitions of <code>&lt;</code> and <code>==</code> yield consistent results.</p>

<h3 id="filepos3140586">12.3. Using the Library: A Text-Query Program</h3>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>To conclude our discussion of the library, we’ll implement a simple text-query program. Our program will let a user search a given file for words that might occur in it. The result of a query will be the number of times the word occurs and a list of lines on which that word appears. If a word occurs more than once on the same line, we’ll display that line only once. Lines will be displayed in ascending order—that is, line 7 should be displayed before line 9, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, we might read the file that contains the input for this chapter and look for the word <code>element</code>. The first few lines of the output would be</p>

```
element occurs 112 times
   (line 36) A set element contains only a key;
   (line 158) operator creates a new element
   (line 160) Regardless of whether the element
   (line 168) When we fetch an element from a map, we
   (line 214) If the element is not found, find returns
```

<p>followed by the remaining 100 or so lines in which the word <code>element</code> occurs.</p>
<h4 id="filepos3142846"><a id="filepos3142879"></a>12.3.1. Design of the Query Program</h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>A good way to start the design of a program is to list the program’s operations. Knowing what operations we need can help us see what data structures we’ll need. Starting from requirements, the tasks our program must do include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When it reads the input, the program must remember the line(s) in which each word appears. Hence, the program will need to read the input a line at a time and break up the lines from the input file into its separate words</li>
    <li>When it generates output,</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The program must be able to fetch the line numbers associated with a given word</li>
        <li>The line numbers must appear in ascending order with no duplicates</li>
        <li>The program must be able to print the text appearing in the input file at a given line number.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<p>These requirements can be met quite neatly by using various library facilities:</p>
<ul><li>We’ll use a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to store a copy of the entire input file. Each line in the input file will be an element in this <code>vector</code>. When we want to print a line, we can fetch the line using its line number as the index.</li><li>We’ll use an <code>istringstream</code> (§ <a href="085-8.3._string_streams.html#filepos2143868">8.3</a>, p. <a href="085-8.3._string_streams.html#filepos2143868">321</a>) to break each line into words.</li><li>We’ll use a <code>set</code> to hold the line numbers on which each word in the input appears. Using a <code>set</code> guarantees that each line will appear only once and that the line numbers will be stored in ascending order.</li><li>We’ll use a <code>map</code> to associate each word with the <code>set</code> of line numbers on which the word appears. Using a <code>map</code> will let us fetch the <code>set</code> for any given word.</li></ul>

<p>For reasons we’ll explain shortly, our solution will also use <code>shared_ptr</code>s.</p>
<h5>Data Structures</h5>
<p>Although we could write our program using <code>vector, set</code>, and <code>map</code> directly, it will be more useful if we define a more abstract solution. We’ll start by designing a class to hold the input file in a way that makes querying the file easy. This class, which we’ll name <code>TextQuery</code>, will hold a <code>vector</code> and a <code>map</code>. The <code>vector</code> will hold the text of the input file; the <code>map</code> will associate each word in that file to the <code>set</code> of line numbers on which that word appears. This class will have a constructor that reads a given input file and an operation to perform the queries.</p>
<p>The work of the query operation is pretty simple: It will look inside its <code>map</code> to see whether the given word is present. The hard part in designing this function is deciding what the query function should return. Once we know that a word was found, we need to know how often it occurred, the line numbers on which it occurred, and the corresponding text for each of those line numbers.</p>
<p>The easiest way to return all those data is to define a second class, which we’ll name <code>QueryResult</code>, to hold the results of a query. This class will have a <code>print</code> function to print the results in a <code>QueryResult</code>.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos3148595"></a>Sharing Data between Classes</h5>
<p>Our <code>QueryResult</code> class is intended to represent the results of a query. Those results include the <code>set</code> of line numbers associated with the given word and the corresponding lines of text from the input file. These data are stored in objects of type <code>TextQuery</code>.</p>
<p>Because the data that a <code>QueryResult</code> needs are stored in a <code>TextQuery</code> object, we have to decide how to access them. We could copy the <code>set</code> of line numbers, but that might be an expensive operation. Moreover, we certainly wouldn’t want to copy the <code>vector</code>, because that would entail copying the entire file in order to print (what will usually be) a small subset of the file.</p>
<p>We could avoid making copies by returning iterators (or pointers) into the <code>TextQuery</code> object. However, this approach opens up a pitfall: What happens if the <code>TextQuery</code> object is destroyed before a corresponding <code>QueryResult</code>? In that case, the <code>QueryResult</code> would refer to data in an object that no longer exists.</p>
<p>This last observation about synchronizing the lifetime of a <code>QueryResult</code> with the <code>TextQuery</code> object whose results it represents suggests a solution to our design problem. Given that these two classes conceptually “share” data, we’ll use <code>shared_ptr</code>s (§ <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2907541">12.1.1</a>, p. <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2907541">450</a>) to reflect that sharing in our data structures.</p>
<h5>Using the <code>TextQuery</code> Class</h5>
<p>When we design a class, it can be helpful to write programs using the class before actually implementing the members. That way, we can see whether the class has the operations we need. For example, the following program uses our proposed <code>TextQuery</code> and <code>QueryResult</code> classes. This function takes an <code>ifstream</code> that points to the file we want to process, and interacts with a user, printing the results for the given words:</p>

```c++
void runQueries(ifstream &infile)
{
    // infile is an ifstream that is the file we want to query
    TextQuery tq(infile);  //  store the file and build the query map
    // iterate with the user: prompt for a word to find and print results
    while (true) {
        cout << "enter word to look for, or q to quit: ";
        string s;
        // stop if we hit end-of-file on the input or if a 'q' is entered
        if (!(cin >> s) || s == "q") break;
        // run the query and print the results
        print(cout, tq.query(s)) << endl;
    }
}
```

<p>We start by initializing a <code>TextQuery</code> object named <code>tq</code> from a given <code>ifstream</code>. The <code>TextQuery</code> constructor reads that file into its <code>vector</code> and builds the <code>map</code> that associates the words in the input with the line numbers on which they appear.</p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop iterates (indefinitely) with the user asking for a word to query and printing the related results. The loop condition tests the literal <code>true</code> (§ <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos326709">2.1.3</a>, p. <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos326709">41</a>), so it always succeeds. We exit the loop through the <code>break</code> (§ <a href="058-5.5._jump_statements.html#filepos1351310">5.5.1</a>, p. <a href="058-5.5._jump_statements.html#filepos1351310">190</a>) <a id="filepos3155219"></a>after the first <code>if</code>. That <code>if</code> checks that the read succeeded. If so, it also checks whether the user entered a <code>q</code> to quit. Once we have a word to look for, we ask <code>tq</code> to find that word and then call <code>print</code> to print the results of the search.</p>

Rewrite the loop to use a <code>do while</code>. Explain which version you prefer and why.</p>
:::

<h4 id="filepos3157528">12.3.2. Defining the Query Program Classes</h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>We’ll start by defining our <code>TextQuery</code> class. The user will create objects of this class by supplying an <code>istream</code> from which to read the input file. This class also provides the <code>query</code> operation that will take a <code>string</code> and return a <code>QueryResult</code> representing the lines on which that <code>string</code> appears.</p>
<p>The data members of the class have to take into account the intended sharing with <code>QueryResult</code> objects. The <code>QueryResult</code> class will share the <code>vector</code> representing the input file and the <code>set</code>s that hold the line numbers associated with each word in the input. Hence, our class has two data members: a <code>shared_ptr</code> to a dynamically allocated <code>vector</code> that holds the input file, and a <code>map</code> from <code>string</code> to <code>shared_ptr&lt;set&gt;</code>. The <code>map</code> associates each word in the file with a dynamically allocated <code>set</code> that holds the line numbers on which that word appears.</p>
<p>To make our code a bit easier to read, we’ll also define a type member (§ <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1852806">7.3.1</a>, p. <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1852806">271</a>) to refer to line numbers, which are indices into a <code>vector</code> of <code>string</code>s:</p>

```c++
class QueryResult; // declaration needed for return type in the query function
class TextQuery {
public:
    using line_no = std::vector<std::string>::size_type;
    TextQuery(std::ifstream&);
    QueryResult query(const std::string&) const;
private:
    std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::string>> file;  // input file
    // map of each word to the set of the lines in which that word appears
    std::map<std::string,
             std::shared_ptr<std::set<line_no>>> wm;
};
```

<p><a id="filepos3161756"></a>The hardest part about this class is untangling the class names. As usual, for code that will go in a header file, we use <code>std::</code> when we use a library name (§ <a href="030-3.1._namespace_using_declarations.html#filepos638596">3.1</a>, p. <a href="030-3.1._namespace_using_declarations.html#filepos638596">83</a>). In this case, the repeated use of <code>std::</code> makes the code a bit hard to read at first. For example,</p>

```c++
std::map<std::string, std::shared_ptr<std::set<line_no>>> wm;
```

<p>is easier to understand when rewritten as</p>

```c++
map<string, shared_ptr<set<line_no>>> wm;
```

<h5>The <code>TextQuery</code> Constructor</h5>
<p>The <code>TextQuery</code> constructor takes an <code>ifstream</code>, which it reads a line at a time:</p>

```c++
// read the input file and build the map of lines to line numbers
TextQuery::TextQuery(ifstream &is): file(new vector<string>)
{
    string text;
    while (getline(is, text)) {       // for each line in the file
        file->push_back(text);        // remember this line of text
        int n = file->size() - 1;     // the current line number
        istringstream line(text);     // separate the line into words
        string word;
        while (line >> word) {        // for each word in that line
            // if word isn't already in wm, subscripting adds a new entry
            auto &lines = wm[word]; // lines is a shared_ptr
            if (!lines) // that pointer is null the first time we see word
                lines.reset(new set<line_no>); // allocate a new set
            lines->insert(n);      // insert this line number
        }
    }
}
```

<p>The constructor initializer allocates a new <code>vector</code> to hold the text from the input file. We use <code>getline</code> to read the file a line at a time and push each line onto the <code>vector</code>. Because <code>file</code> is a <code>shared_ptr</code>, we use the <code>-&gt;</code> operator to dereference <code>file</code> to fetch the <code>push_back</code> member of the <code>vector</code> to which <code>file</code> points.</p>
<p>Next we use an <code>istringstream</code> (§ <a href="085-8.3._string_streams.html#filepos2143868">8.3</a>, p. <a href="085-8.3._string_streams.html#filepos2143868">321</a>) to process each word in the line we just read. The inner <code>while</code> uses the <code>istringstream</code> input operator to read each word from the current line into <code>word</code>. Inside the <code>while</code>, we use the <code>map</code> subscript operator to fetch the <code>shared_ptr&lt;set&gt;</code> associated with <code>word</code> and bind <code>lines</code> to that pointer. Note that <code>lines</code> is a reference, so changes made to <code>lines</code> will be made to the element in <code>wm</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>word</code> wasn’t in the <code>map</code>, the subscript operator adds <code>word</code> to <code>wm</code> (§ <a href="109-11.3._operations_on_associative_containers.html#filepos2820595">11.3.4</a>, p. <a href="109-11.3._operations_on_associative_containers.html#filepos2820595">435</a>). The element associated with <code>word</code> is value initialized, which means that <code>lines</code> will be a null pointer if the subscript operator added <code>word</code> to <code>wm</code>. If <code>lines</code> is null, we allocate a <code>new set</code> and call <code>reset</code> to update the <code>shared_ptr</code> to which <code>lines</code> refers to point to this newly allocated <code>set</code>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we created a new <code>set</code>, we call <code>insert</code> to add the current line number. Because <code>lines</code> is a reference, the call to <code>insert</code> adds an element <a id="filepos3170995"></a>to the <code>set</code> in <code>wm</code>. If a given word occurs more than once in the same line, the call to <code>insert</code> does nothing.</p>
<h5>The <code>QueryResult</code> Class</h5>
<p>The <code>QueryResult</code> class has three data members: a <code>string</code> that is the word whose results it represents; a <code>shared_ptr</code> to the <code>vector</code> containing the input file; and a <code>shared_ptr</code> to the <code>set</code> of line numbers on which this word appears. Its only member function is a constructor that initializes these three members:</p>

```c++
class QueryResult {
friend std::ostream& print(std::ostream&, const QueryResult&);
public:
    QueryResult(std::string s,
                std::shared_ptr<std::set<line_no>> p,
                std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::string>> f):
        sought(s), lines(p), file(f) { }
private:
    std::string sought;  // word this query represents
    std::shared_ptr<std::set<line_no>> lines; // lines it's on
    std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::string>> file; // input file
};
```

<p>The constructor’s only job is to store its arguments in the corresponding data members, which it does in the constructor initializer list (§ <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">7.1.4</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">265</a>).</p>
<h5>The <code>query</code> Function</h5>
<p>The <code>query</code> function takes a <code>string</code>, which it uses to locate the corresponding <code>set</code> of line numbers in the <code>map</code>. If the <code>string</code> is found, the <code>query</code> function constructs a <code>QueryResult</code> from the given <code>string</code>, the <code>TextQuery file</code> member, and the <code>set</code> that was fetched from <code>wm</code>.</p>
<p>The only question is: What should we return if the given <code>string</code> is not found? In this case, there is no <code>set</code> to return. We’ll solve this problem by defining a local <code>static</code> object that is a <code>shared_ptr</code> to an empty <code>set</code> of line numbers. When the word is not found, we’ll return a copy of this <code>shared_ptr</code>:</p>

```c++
QueryResult
TextQuery::query(const string &sought) const
{
    // we'll return a pointer to this set if we don't find sought
    static shared_ptr<set<line_no>> nodata(new set<line_no>);
    // use find and not a subscript to avoid adding words to wm!
    auto loc = wm.find(sought);
    if (loc == wm.end())
        return QueryResult(sought, nodata, file); // not found
    else
        return QueryResult(sought, loc->second, file);
}
```

<h5><a id="filepos3177453"></a>Printing the Results</h5>
<p>The <code>print</code> function prints its given <code>QueryResult</code> object on its given stream:</p>

```c++
ostream &print(ostream & os, const QueryResult &qr)
{
    // if the word was found, print the count and all occurrences
    os << qr.sought << " occurs " << qr.lines->size() << " "
       << make_plural(qr.lines->size(), "time", "s") << endl;
    // print each line in which the word appeared
    for (auto num : *qr.lines) // for every element in the set
        // don't confound the user with text lines starting at 0
        os << "\t(line " << num + 1 << ") "
           << *(qr.file->begin() + num) << endl;
    return os;
}
```

<p>We use the <code>size</code> of the <code>set</code> to which the <code>qr.lines</code> points to report how many matches were found. Because that <code>set</code> is in a <code>shared_ptr</code>, we have to remember to dereference <code>lines</code>. We call <code>make_plural</code> (§ <a href="065-6.3._return_types_and_the_return_statement.html#filepos1552941">6.3.2</a>, p. <a href="065-6.3._return_types_and_the_return_statement.html#filepos1552941">224</a>) to print <code>time</code> or <code>times</code>, depending on whether that size is equal to 1.</p>
<p>In the <code>for</code> we iterate through the <code>set</code> to which <code>lines</code> points. The body of the <code>for</code> prints the line number, adjusted to use human-friendly counting. The numbers in the <code>set</code> are indices of elements in the <code>vector</code>, which are numbered from zero. However, most users think of the first line as line number 1, so we systematically add 1 to the line numbers to convert to this more common notation.</p>
<p>We use the line number to fetch a line from the <code>vector</code> to which <code>file</code> points. Recall that when we add a number to an iterator, we get the element that many elements further into the <code>vector</code> (§ <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos839265">3.4.2</a>, p. <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos839265">111</a>). Thus, <code>file-&gt;begin() + num</code> is the <code>num</code>th element after the start of the <code>vector</code> to which <code>file</code> points.</p>
<p>Note that this function correctly handles the case that the word is not found. In this case, the <code>set</code> will be empty. The first output statement will note that the word occurred 0 times. Because <code>*res.lines</code> is empty. the <code>for</code> loop won’t be executed.</p>

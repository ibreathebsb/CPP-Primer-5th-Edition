<h3 id="filepos1233029">5.1. Simple Statements</h3>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Most statements in C++ end with a semicolon. An expression, such as <code>ival + 5</code>, becomes an <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1406557" id="filepos1233374">expression statement</a></strong> when it is followed by a semicolon. Expression statements cause the expression to be evaluated and its result discarded:</p>

```c++
ival + 5;      // rather useless expression statement
cout << ival;  // useful expression statement
```

<p>The first statement is pretty useless: The addition is done but the result is not used. More commonly, an expression statement contains an expression that has a side effect—such as assigning a new value to a variable, or printing a result—when it is evaluated.</p>
<h4>Null Statements</h4>
<p>The simplest statement is the empty statement, also known as a <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1409102" id="filepos1234682">null statement</a></strong>. A null statement is a single semicolon:</p>

```c++
; // null statement
```

<p>A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the program’s logic does not. Such usage is most common when a loop’s work can be done within its condition. For example, we might want to read an input stream, ignoring everything we read until we encounter a particular value:</p>

```c++
// read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought
while (cin >> s && s != sought)
    ; // null statement
```

<p>This condition reads a value from the standard input and implicitly tests <code>cin</code> to see whether the read was successful. Assuming the read succeeded, the second part of the condition tests whether the value we read is equal to the value in <code>sought</code>. If we found the value we want, the <code>while</code> loop is exited. Otherwise, the condition is evaluated again, which reads another value from <code>cin</code>.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Null statements should be commented. That way anyone reading the code can see that the statement was omitted intentionally.</p>

<h4>Beware of Missing or Extraneous Semicolons</h4>
<p>Because a null statement is a statement, it is legal anywhere a statement is expected. For this reason, semicolons that might appear illegal are often nothing more than null statements. The following fragment contains two statements—the expression statement and the null statement:</p>
<p><a id="filepos1237722"></a></p>

```c++
ival = v1 + v2;; // ok: second semicolon is a superfluous null statement
```

<p>Although an unnecessary null statement is often harmless, an extra semicolon following the condition in a <code>while</code> or <code>if</code> can drastically alter the programmer’s intent. For example, the following code will loop indefinitely:</p>

```c++
// disaster: extra semicolon: loop body is this null statement
while (iter != svec.end()) ; // the while body is the empty statement
    ++iter;     // increment is not part of the loop
```

<p>Contrary to the indentation, the increment is not part of the loop. The loop body is the null statement formed by the semicolon that follows the condition.</p>

<h4>Compound Statements (Blocks)</h4>
<p>A <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1402443" id="filepos1240117">compound statement</a></strong>, usually referred to as a <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1400527" id="filepos1240223">block</a></strong>, is a (possibly empty) sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces. A block is a scope (§ <a href="022-2.2._variables.html#filepos382972">2.2.4</a>, p. <a href="022-2.2._variables.html#filepos382972">48</a>). Names introduced inside a block are accessible only in that block and in blocks nested inside that block. Names are visible from where they are defined until the end of the (immediately) enclosing block.</p>
<p>Compound statements are used when the language requires a single statement but the logic of our program needs more than one. For example, the body of a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop must be a single statement, yet we often need to execute more than one statement in the body of a loop. We do so by enclosing the statements in curly braces, thus turning the sequence of statements into a block.</p>
<p>As one example, recall the <code>while</code> loop in the program in § <a href="014-1.4._flow_of_control.html#filepos166704">1.4.1</a> (p. <a href="014-1.4._flow_of_control.html#filepos166704">11</a>):</p>

```c++
while (val <= 10) {
    sum += val;  // assigns sum + val to sum
    ++val;       // add 1 to val
}
```

<p>The logic of our program needed two statements but a <code>while</code> loop may contain only one statement. By enclosing these statements in curly braces, we made them into a single (compound) statement.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>A block is <em>not</em> terminated by a semicolon.</p>
:::

<p>We also can define an empty block by writing a pair of curlies with no statements. An empty block is equivalent to a null statement:</p>

```c++
while (cin >> s && s != sought)
    { } // empty block
```

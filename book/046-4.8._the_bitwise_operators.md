<h3 id="filepos1120642">4.8. The Bitwise Operators</h3>
<p>The bitwise operators take operands of integral type that they use as a collection of bits. These operators let us test and set individual bits. As we’ll see in § <a href="164-17.2._the_bitset_type.html#filepos4603212">17.2</a> (p. <a href="164-17.2._the_bitset_type.html#filepos4603212">723</a>), we can also use these operators on a library type named <code>bitset</code> that represents a flexibly sized collection of bits.</p>
<p>As usual, if an operand is a “small integer,” its value is first promoted (§ <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1162796">4.11.1</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1162796">160</a>) to a larger integral type. The operand(s) can be either signed or unsigned.</p>
<p><a id="filepos1121570"></a>Table 4.3. Bitwise Operators (Left Associative)</p>

<p>If the operand is signed and its value is negative, then the way that the “sign bit” is handled in a number of the bitwise operations is machine dependent. Moreover, doing a left shift that changes the value of the sign bit is undefined.</p>

<p>Warning</p>
<p>Because there are no guarantees for how the sign bit is handled, we strongly recommend using <code>unsigned</code> types with the bitwise operators.</p>

<h4>Bitwise Shift Operators</h4>
<p>We have already used the overloaded versions of the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators that the IO library defines to do input and output. The built-in meaning of these operators is that they perform a bitwise shift on their operands. They yield a value that is a copy of the (possibly promoted) left-hand operand with the bits shifted as directed by the right-hand operand. The right-hand operand must not be negative and must be a value that is strictly less than the number of bits in the result. Otherwise, the operation is undefined. The bits are shifted left (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>) or right (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>). Bits that are shifted off the end are discarded:</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00033.jpg"/>
<p>The left-shift operator (the <a href="052-defined_terms.html#filepos1228184" id="filepos1123791"><code>&lt;&lt;</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>) inserts 0-valued bits on the right. The behavior of the right-shift operator (the <a href="052-defined_terms.html#filepos1229053" id="filepos1124082"><code>&gt;&gt;</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>) depends on the type of the left-hand operand: If that operand is <code>unsigned</code>, then the operator inserts 0-valued <a id="filepos1124464"></a>bits on the left; if it is a signed type, the result is implementation defined—either copies of the sign bit or 0-valued bits are inserted on the left.</p>
<h4>Bitwise <small>NOT</small> Operator</h4>
<p>The bitwise <small>NOT</small> operator (the <a href="052-defined_terms.html#filepos1229657" id="filepos1124838"><code>~</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>) generates a new value with the bits of its operand inverted. Each 1 bit is set to 0; each 0 bit is set to 1:</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00034.jpg"/>
<p>Here, our <code>char</code> operand is first promoted to <code>int</code>. Promoting a <code>char</code> to <code>int</code> leaves the value unchanged but adds 0 bits to the high order positions. Thus, promoting <code>bits</code> to <code>int</code> adds 24 high order bits, all of which are 0-valued. The bits in the promoted value are inverted.</p>
<h4>Bitwise <small>AND</small>, <small>OR</small>, and <small>XOR</small> Operators</h4>
<p>The <small>AND</small> (<code>&amp;</code>), <small>OR</small> (<code>|</code>), and <small>XOR</small> (<code>^</code>) operators generate new values with the bit pattern composed from its two operands:</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00035.jpg"/>
<p>For each bit position in the result of the bitwise <small>AND</small> operator (the <a href="052-defined_terms.html#filepos1224608" id="filepos1126738"><code>&amp;</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>) the bit is 1 if both operands contain 1; otherwise, the result is 0. For the <small>OR</small> (inclusive or) operator (the <a href="052-defined_terms.html#filepos1226189" id="filepos1127068"><code>|</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>), the bit is 1 if either or both operands contain 1; otherwise, the result is 0. For the <small>XOR</small> (exclusive or) operator (the <a href="052-defined_terms.html#filepos1225089" id="filepos1127406"><code>^</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>), the bit is 1 if either but not both operands contain 1; otherwise, the result is 0.</p>

::: warning
<p>Warning</p>
<p>It is a common error to confuse the bitwise and logical operators (§ <a href="041-4.3._logical_and_relational_operators.html#filepos1044115">4.3</a>, p. <a href="041-4.3._logical_and_relational_operators.html#filepos1044115">141</a>). For example to confuse the bitwise <code>&amp;</code> with the logical <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, the bitwise <code>|</code> with the logical <code>||</code>, and the bitwise <code>~</code> and the logical <code>!</code>).</p>

<h4>Using Bitwise Operators</h4>
<p>As an example of using the bitwise operators let’s assume a teacher has 30 students in a class. Each week the class is given a pass/fail quiz. We’ll track the results of each quiz using one bit per student to represent the pass or fail grade on a given test. We might represent each quiz in an <code>unsigned</code> integral value:</p>

```c++
unsigned long quiz1 = 0; // we'll use this value as a collection of bits
```

<p><a id="filepos1129722"></a>We define <code>quiz1</code> as an <code>unsigned long</code>. Thus, <code>quiz1</code> will have at least 32 bits on any machine. We explicitly initialize <code>quiz1</code> to ensure that the bits start out with well-defined values.</p>
<p>The teacher must be able to set and test individual bits. For example, we’d like to be able to set the bit corresponding to student number 27 to indicate that this student passed the quiz. We can indicate that student number 27 passed by creating a value that has only bit 27 turned on. If we then bitwise <small>OR</small> that value with <code>quiz1</code>, all the bits except bit 27 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this example, we will count the bits of <code>quiz1</code> by assigning 0 to the low-order bit, 1 to the next bit, and so on.</p>
<p>We can obtain a value indicating that student 27 passed by using the left-shift operator and an <code>unsigned long</code> integer literal 1 (§ <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos326709">2.1.3</a>, p. <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos326709">38</a>):</p>

```c++
1UL << 27 // generate a value with only bit number 27 set
```

<p><code>1UL</code> has a 1 in the low-order bit and (at least) 31 zero bits. We specified <code>unsigned long</code> because <code>int</code>s are only guaranteed to have 16 bits, and we need at least 17. This expression shifts the 1 bit left 27 positions inserting 0 bits behind it.</p>
<p>Next we <small>OR</small> this value with <code>quiz1</code>. Because we want to update the value of <code>quiz1</code>, we use a compound assignment (§ <a href="042-4.4._assignment_operators.html#filepos1066463">4.4</a>, p. <a href="042-4.4._assignment_operators.html#filepos1066463">147</a>):</p>

```c++
quiz1 |= 1UL << 27; // indicate student number 27 passed
```

<p>The <code>|=</code> operator executes analogously to how <code>+=</code> does. It is equivalent to</p>

```c++
quiz1 = quiz1 | 1UL << 27; // equivalent to quiz1 | = 1UL << 27;
```

<p>Imagine that the teacher reexamined the quiz and discovered that student 27 actually had failed the test. The teacher must now turn off bit 27. This time we need an integer that has bit 27 turned off and all the other bits turned on. We’ll bitwise <small>AND</small> this value with <code>quiz1</code> to turn off just that bit:</p>

```c++
quiz1 &= ~(1UL << 27); // student number 27 failed
```

<p>We obtain a value with all but bit 27 turned on by inverting our previous value. That value had 0 bits in all but bit 27, which was a 1. Applying the bitwise <small>NOT</small> to that value will turn off bit 27 and turn on all the others. When we bitwise <small>AND</small> this value with <code>quiz1</code>, all except bit 27 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Finally, we might want to know how the student at position 27 fared:</p>

```c++
bool status = quiz1 & (1UL << 27); // how did student number 27 do?
```

<p>Here we <small>AND</small> a value that has bit 27 turned on with <code>quiz1</code>. The result is nonzero (i.e., true) if bit 27 of <code>quiz1</code> is also on; otherwise, it evaluates to zero.</p>
<h4>Shift Operators (aka IO Operators) Are Left Associative</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Although many programmers never use the bitwise operators directly, most programmers do use overloaded versions of these operators for IO. An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as the built-in version of that operator. Therefore, programmers need to understand the precedence and associativity of the shift operators even if they never use them with their built-in meaning.</p>
<p>Because the shift operators are left associative, the expression</p>
<p><a id="filepos1136915"></a></p>

```c++
cout << "hi" << " there" << endl;
```

<p>executes as</p>

```c++
( (cout << "hi") << " there" ) << endl;
```

<p>In this statement, the operand <code>"hi"</code> is grouped with the first <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol. Its result is grouped with the second, and then that result is grouped with the third.</p>
<p>The shift operators have midlevel precedence: lower than the arithmetic operators but higher than the relational, assignment, and conditional operators. These relative precedence levels mean we usually have to use parentheses to force the correct grouping of operators with lower precedence.</p>

```c++
cout << 42 + 10;   // ok: + has higher precedence, so the sum is printed
cout << (10 < 42); // ok: parentheses force intended grouping; prints 1
cout << 10 < 42;   // error: attempt to compare cout to 42!
```

<p>The last <code>cout</code> is interpreted as</p>

```c++
(cout << 10) < 42;
```

<p>which says to “write <code>10</code> onto <code>cout</code> and then compare the result of that operation (i.e., <code>cout</code>) to <code>42</code>.”</p>

<h3>A Note about Compilers</h3>
<p>As of this writing (July, 2012), compiler vendors are hard at work updating their compilers to match the latest ISO standard. The compiler we use most frequently is the GNU compiler, version 4.7.0. There are only a few features used in this book that this compiler does not yet implement: inheriting constructors, reference qualifiers for member functions, and the regular-expression library.</p>

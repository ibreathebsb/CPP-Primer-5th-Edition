<p>C++ provides a limited number of statements. Most of these affect the flow of control within a program:</p>
<ul><li><code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>do while</code> statements, which provide iterative execution.</li><li><code>if</code> and <code>switch</code>, which provide conditional execution.</li><li><code>continue</code>, which stops the current iteration of a loop.</li><li><code>break</code>, which exits a loop or <code>switch</code> statement.</li><li><code>goto</code>, which transfers control to a labeled statement.</li><li><code>try</code> and <code>catch</code>, which define a <code>try</code> block enclosing a sequence of statements that might throw an exception. The <code>catch</code> clause(s) are intended to handle the exception(s) that the enclosed code might throw.</li><li><code>throw</code> expression statements, which exit a block of code, transferring control to an associated <code>catch</code> clause.</li><li><code>return</code>, which stops execution of a function. (Weâ€™ll cover <code>return</code> statements in <a href="062-chapter_6._functions.html#filepos1412784">Chapter 6</a>.)</li></ul>

<p>In addition, there are expression statements and declaration statements. An expression statement causes the subject expression to be evaluated. Declarations and definitions of variables were described in <a href="020-chapter_2._variables_and_basic_types.html#filepos284544">Chapter 2</a>.</p>

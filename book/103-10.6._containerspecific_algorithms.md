<h3 id="filepos2700621">10.6. Container-Specific Algorithms</h3>
<p>Unlike the other containers, <code>list</code> and <code>forward_list</code> define several algorithms as members. In particular, the list types define their own versions of <code>sort, merge, remove, reverse</code>, and <code>unique</code>. The generic version of <code>sort</code> requires random-access iterators. As a result, <code>sort</code> cannot be used with <code>list</code> and <code>forward_list</code> because these types offer bidirectional and forward iterators, respectively.</p>
<p>The generic versions of the other algorithms that the list types define can be used with lists, but at a cost in performance. These algorithms swap elements in the input sequence. A list can “swap” its elements by changing the links among its elements rather than swapping the values of those elements. As a result, the list-specific versions of these algorithms can achieve much better performance than the corresponding generic versions.</p>
<p>These <code>list</code>-specific operations are described in <a href="103-10.6._containerspecific_algorithms.html#filepos2702733">Table 10.6</a>. Generic algorithms not listed in the table that take appropriate iterators execute equally efficiently on <code>list</code>s and <code>forward_lists</code>s as on other containers.</p>

| `lst.merge(lst2)` `lst.merge(lst2, comp)` | Merges elements from `lst2` onto `lst`. Both `lst` and `lst2` must be sorted. Elements are removed from `lst2`. After the merge, `lst2` is empty. The first version uses the `<` operator; the second version uses the given comparison operation. |
| `lst.remove(val)` `lst.remove_if(pred)`   | Calls `erase` to remove each element that is `==` to the given value or for which the given unary predicate succeeds.                                                                                                                              |

<h4><a id="filepos2703787"></a>The <code>splice</code> Members</h4>
<Badge type="danger" text="Advanced" />
<p>The list types also define a <code>splice</code> algorithm, which is described in <a href="103-10.6._containerspecific_algorithms.html#filepos2704423">Table 10.7</a>. This algorithm is particular to list data structures. Hence a generic version of this algorithm is not needed.</p>

**`lst.splice(args)` or `flst.splice_after(args)`**

| `args`            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `(p, lst2)`       | `p` is an iterator to an element in `lst` or an iterator just before an element in `flst`. Moves all the element(s) from `lst2` into `lst` just before `p` or into `flst` just after `p`. Removes the element(s) from `lst2`. `lst2` must have the same type as `lst` or `flst` and may not be the same list. |
| `(p, lst2, p2)`   | `p2` is a valid iterator into `lst2`. Moves the element denoted by `p2` into `lst` or moves the element just after `p2` into `flst`. `lst2` can be the same list as `lst` or `flst`.                                                                                                                          |
| `(p, lst2, b, e)` | `b` and `e` must denote a valid range in `lst2`. Moves the elements in the given range from `lst2`. `lst2` and `lst` (or `flst`) can be the same list but `p` must not denote an element in the given range.                                                                                                  |

<h4>The List-Specific Operations Do Change the Containers</h4>
<p>Most of the list-specific algorithms are similar—but not identical—to their generic counterparts. However, a crucially important difference between the list-specific and the generic versions is that the list versions change the underlying container. For example, the list version of <code>remove</code> removes the indicated elements. The list version of <code>unique</code> removes the second and subsequent duplicate elements.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>merge</code> and <code>splice</code> are destructive on their arguments. For example, the generic version of <code>merge</code> writes the merged sequence to a given destination iterator; the two input sequences are unchanged. The list <code>merge</code> function destroys the given list—elements are removed from the argument list as they are merged into the object on which <code>merge</code> was called. After a <code>merge</code>, the elements from both lists continue to exist, but they are all elements of the same list.</p>

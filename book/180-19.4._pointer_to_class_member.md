<h3 id="filepos5224528">19.4. Pointer to Class Member</h3>
<p>A <strong><a href="186-defined_terms.html#filepos5406339" id="filepos5224670">pointer to member</a></strong> is a pointer that can point to a non<code>static</code> member of a class. Normally a pointer points to an object, but a pointer to member identifies a member of a class, not an object of that class. <code>static</code> class members are not part of any object, so no special syntax is needed to point to a <code>static</code> member. Pointers to <code>static</code> members are ordinary pointers.</p>
<p>The type of a pointer to member embodies both the type of a class and the type of a member of that class. We initialize such pointers to point to a specific member of a class without identifying an object to which that member belongs. When we use a pointer to member, we supply the object whose member we wish to use.</p>
<p><a id="filepos5225785"></a>To explain pointers to members, we’ll use a version of the <code>Screen</code> class from § <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1852806">7.3.1</a> (p. <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1852806">271</a>):</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    typedef std::string::size_type pos;
    char get_cursor() const { return contents[cursor]; }
    char get() const;
    char get(pos ht, pos wd) const;
private:
    std::string contents;
    pos cursor;
    pos height, width;
};
```

<h4 id="filepos5226766">19.4.1. Pointers to Data Members</h4>
<p>As with any pointer, we declare a pointer to member using a <code>*</code> to indicate that the name we’re declaring is a pointer. Unlike ordinary pointers, a pointer to member also incorporates the class that contains the member. Hence, we must precede the <code>*</code> with <em>classname</em><code>::</code> to indicate that the pointer we are defining can point to a member of <em>classname</em>. For example:</p>

```c++
// pdata can point to a string member of a const (or non const) Screen object
const string Screen::*pdata;
```

<p>declares that <code>pdata</code> is a “pointer to a member of class <code>Screen</code> that has type <code>const string</code>.” The data members in a <code>const</code> object are themselves <code>const</code>. By making our pointer a pointer to <code>const string</code> member, we say that we can use <code>pdata</code> to point to a member of any <code>Screen</code> object, <code>const</code> or not. In exchange we can use <code>pdata</code> to read, but not write to, the member to which it points.</p>
<p>When we initialize (or assign to) a pointer to member, we say to which member it points. For example, we can make <code>pdata</code> point to the <code>contents</code> member of an unspecified <code>Screen</code> object as follows:</p>

```c++
pdata = &Screen::contents;
```

<p>Here, we apply the address-of operator not to an object in memory but to a member of the class <code>Screen</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, under the new standard, the easiest way to declare a pointer to member is to use <code>auto</code> or <code>decltype</code>:</p>

```c++
auto pdata = &Screen::contents;
```

<h5>Using a Pointer to Data Member</h5>
<p>It is essential to understand that when we initialize or assign a pointer to member, that pointer does not yet point to any data. It identifies a specific member but not the object that contains that member. We supply the object when we dereference the pointer to member.</p>
<p><a id="filepos5231349"></a>Analogous to the member access operators, <code>.</code> and <code>-&gt;</code>, there are two pointer-to-member access operators, <code>.*</code> and <code>-&gt;*</code>, that let us supply an object and dereference the pointer to fetch a member of that object:</p>

```c++
Screen myScreen, *pScreen = &myScreen;
// .* dereferences pdata to fetch the contents member from the object myScreen
auto s = myScreen.*pdata;
// ->* dereferences pdata to fetch contents from the object to which pScreen points
s = pScreen->*pdata;
```

<p>Conceptually, these operators perform two actions: They dereference the pointer to member to get the member that we want; then, like the member access operators, they fetch that member from an object (<code>.*</code>) or through a pointer (<code>-&gt;*</code>).</p>
<h5>A Function Returning a Pointer to Data Member</h5>
<p>Normal access controls apply to pointers to members. For example, the <code>contents</code> member of <code>Screen</code> is <code>private</code>. As a result, the use of <code>pdata</code> above must have been inside a member or friend of class <code>Screen</code> or it would be an error.</p>
<p>Because data members are typically <code>private</code>, we normally can’t get a pointer to data member directly. Instead, if a class like <code>Screen</code> wanted to allow access to its <code>contents</code> member, it would define a function to return a pointer to that member:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    // data is a static member that returns a pointer to member
    static const std::string Screen::*data()
        { return &Screen::contents; }
    // other members as before
};
```

<p>Here we’ve added a <code>static</code> member to class <code>Screen</code> that returns a pointer to the <code>contents</code> member of a <code>Screen</code>. The return type of this function is the same type as our original <code>pdata</code> pointer. Reading the return type from right to left, we see that <code>data</code> returns a pointer to a member of class <code>Screen</code> that is a <code>string</code> that is <code>const</code>. The body of the function applies the address-of operator to the <code>contents</code> member, so the function returns a pointer to the <code>contents</code> member of <code>Screen</code>.</p>
<p>When we call <code>data</code>, we get a pointer to member:</p>

```c++
// data() returns a pointer to the contents member of class Screen
const string Screen::*pdata = Screen::data();
```

<p>As before, <code>pdata</code> points to a member of class <code>Screen</code> but not to actual data. To use <code>pdata</code>, we must bind it to an object of type <code>Screen</code></p>

```c++
// fetch the contents of the object named myScreen
auto s = myScreen.*pdata;
```

:::

<h4 id="filepos5240360">19.4.2. Pointers to Member Functions</h4>
<p>We can also define a pointer that can point to a member function of a class. As with pointers to data members, the easiest way to form a pointer to member function is to use <code>auto</code> to deduce the type for us:</p>

```c++
// pmf is a pointer that can point to a Screen member function that is const
// that returns a char and takes no arguments
auto pmf = &Screen::get_cursor;
```

<p>Like a pointer to data member, a pointer to a function member is declared using <em>classname</em><code>::*</code>. Like any other function pointer (§ <a href="069-6.7._pointers_to_functions.html#filepos1702852">6.7</a>, p. <a href="069-6.7._pointers_to_functions.html#filepos1702852">247</a>), a pointer to member function specifies the return type and parameter list of the type of function to which this pointer can point. If the member function is a <code>const</code> member (§ <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1761316">7.1.2</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1761316">258</a>) or a reference member (§ <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3505762">13.6.3</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3505762">546</a>), we must include the <code>const</code> or reference qualifier as well.</p>
<p>As with normal function pointers, if the member is overloaded, we must distinguish which function we want by declaring the type explicitly (§ <a href="069-6.7._pointers_to_functions.html#filepos1702852">6.7</a>, p. <a href="069-6.7._pointers_to_functions.html#filepos1702852">248</a>). For example, we can declare a pointer to the two-parameter version of <code>get</code> as</p>

```c++
char (Screen::*pmf2)(Screen::pos, Screen::pos) const;
pmf2 = &Screen::get;
```

<p>The parentheses around <code>Screen::*</code> in this declaration are essential due to precedence. Without the parentheses, the compiler treats the following as an (invalid) function declaration:</p>

```c++
// error: nonmember function p cannot have a const qualifier
char Screen::*p(Screen::pos, Screen::pos) const;
```

<p>This declaration tries to define an ordinary function named <code>p</code> that returns a pointer to a member of class <code>Screen</code> that has type <code>char</code>. Because it declares an ordinary function, the declaration can’t be followed by a <code>const</code> qualifier.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary function pointers, there is no automatic conversion between a member function and a pointer to that member:</p>

```c++
// pmf points to a Screen member that takes no arguments and returns char
pmf = &Screen::get; // must explicitly use the address-of operator
pmf = Screen::get;  // error: no conversion to pointer for member functions
```

<h5><a id="filepos5246229"></a>Using a Pointer to Member Function</h5>
<p>As when we use a pointer to a data member, we use the <code>.*</code> or <code>-&gt;*</code> operators to call a member function through a pointer to member:</p>

```c++
Screen myScreen,*pScreen = &myScreen;
// call the function to which pmf points on the object to which pScreen points
char c1 = (pScreen->*pmf)();
// passes the arguments 0, 0 to the two-parameter version of get on the object myScreen
char c2 = (myScreen.*pmf2)(0, 0);
```

<p>The calls <code>(myScreen-&gt;*pmf)()</code> and <code>(pScreen.*pmf2)(0,0)</code> require the parentheses because the precedence of the call operator is higher than the precedence of the pointer to member operators.</p>
<p>Without the parentheses,</p>

```c++
myScreen.*pmf()
```

<p>would be interpreted to mean</p>

```c++
myScreen.*(pmf())
```

<p>This code says to call the function named <code>pmf</code> and use its return value as the operand of the pointer-to-member operator (<code>.*</code>). However, <code>pmf</code> is not a function, so this code is in error.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>Because of the relative precedence of the call operator, declarations of pointers to member functions and calls through such pointers must use parentheses: <code>(C::*p)(parms)</code> and <code>(obj.*p)(args)</code>.</p>
:::

<h5>Using Type Aliases for Member Pointers</h5>
<p>Type aliases or <code>typedef</code>s (§ <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos536134">2.5.1</a>, p. <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos536134">67</a>) make pointers to members considerably easier to read. For example, the following type alias defines <code>Action</code> as an alternative name for the type of the two-parameter version of <code>get</code>:</p>

```c++
// Action is a type that can point to a member function of Screen
// that returns a char and takes two pos arguments
using Action =
char (Screen::*)(Screen::pos, Screen::pos) const;
```

<p><code>Action</code> is another name for the type “pointer to a <code>const</code> member function of class <code>Screen</code> taking two parameters of type <code>pos</code> and returning <code>char</code>.” Using this alias, we can simplify the definition of a pointer to <code>get</code> as follows:</p>

```c++
Action get = &Screen::get; // get points to the get member of Screen
```

<p>As with any other function pointer, we can use a pointer-to-member function type as the return type or as a parameter type in a function. Like any other parameter, a pointer-to-member parameter can have a default argument:</p>

```c++
// action takes a reference to a Screen and a pointer to a Screen member function
Screen& action(Screen&, Action = &Screen::get);
```

<p><a id="filepos5254029"></a><code>action</code> is a function taking two parameters, which are a reference to a <code>Screen</code> object and a pointer to a member function of class <code>Screen</code> that takes two <code>pos</code> parameters and returns a <code>char</code>. We can call <code>action</code> by passing it either a pointer or the address of an appropriate member function in <code>Screen</code>:</p>

```c++
Screen myScreen;
// equivalent calls:
action(myScreen);      // uses the default argument
action(myScreen, get); // uses the variable get that we previously defined
action(myScreen, &Screen::get); // passes the address explicitly
```

<p>Note</p>
<p>Type aliases make code that uses pointers to members much easier to read and write.</p>
:::

<h5>Pointer-to-Member Function Tables</h5>
<p>One common use for function pointers and for pointers to member functions is to store them in a function table (§ <a href="137-14.8._functioncall_operator.html#filepos3690557">14.8.3</a>, p. <a href="137-14.8._functioncall_operator.html#filepos3690557">577</a>). For a class that has several members of the same type, such a table can be used to select one from the set of these members. Let’s assume that our <code>Screen</code> class is extended to contain several member functions, each of which moves the cursor in a particular direction:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    // other interface and implementation members as before
    Screen& home();     // cursor movement functions
    Screen& forward();
    Screen& back();
    Screen& up();
    Screen& down();
};
```

<p>Each of these new functions takes no parameters and returns a reference to the <code>Screen</code> on which it was invoked.</p>
<p>We might want to define a <code>move</code> function that can call any one of these functions and perform the indicated action. To support this new function, we’ll add a <code>static</code> member to <code>Screen</code> that will be an array of pointers to the cursor movement functions:</p>

```c++
class Screen {
public:
    // other interface and implementation members as before
    // Action is a pointer that can be assigned any of the cursor movement members
    using Action = Screen& (Screen::*)();
    // specify which direction to move; enum see § 19.3 (p. 832)
    enum Directions { HOME, FORWARD, BACK, UP, DOWN };
    Screen& move(Directions);
private:
    static Action Menu[];      // function table
};
```

<p><a id="filepos5259845"></a>The array named <code>Menu</code> will hold pointers to each of the cursor movement functions. Those functions will be stored at the offsets corresponding to the enumerators in <code>Directions</code>. The <code>move</code> function takes an enumerator and calls the appropriate function:</p>

```c++
Screen& Screen::move(Directions cm)
{
    // run the element indexed by cm on this object
    return (this->*Menu[cm])(); // Menu[cm] points to a member function
}
```

<p>The call inside <code>move</code> is evaluated as follows: The <code>Menu</code> element indexed by <code>cm</code> is fetched. That element is a pointer to a member function of the <code>Screen</code> class. We call the member function to which that element points on behalf of the object to which <code>this</code> points.</p>
<p>When we call <code>move</code>, we pass it an enumerator that indicates which direction to move the cursor:</p>

```c++
Screen myScreen;
myScreen.move(Screen::HOME);  // invokes myScreen.home
myScreen.move(Screen::DOWN);  // invokes myScreen.down
```

<p>What’s left is to define and initialize the table itself:</p>

```c++
Screen::Action Screen::Menu[] = { &Screen::home,
                                  &Screen::forward,
                                  &Screen::back,
                                  &Screen::up,
                                  &Screen::down,
                                };
```

<h4 id="filepos5266018">19.4.3. Using Member Functions as Callable Objects</h4>
<p>As we’ve seen, to make a call through a pointer to member function, we must use the <code>.*</code> or <code>-&gt;*</code> operators to bind the pointer to a specific object. As a result, <a id="filepos5266464"></a>unlike ordinary function pointers, a pointer to member is <em>not</em> a callable object; these pointers do not support the function-call operator (§ <a href="100-10.3._customizing_operations.html#filepos2530282">10.3.2</a>, p. <a href="100-10.3._customizing_operations.html#filepos2530282">388</a>).</p>
<p>Because a pointer to member is not a callable object, we cannot directly pass a pointer to a member function to an algorithm. As an example, if we wanted to find the first empty <code>string</code> in a <code>vector</code> of <code>string</code>s, the obvious call won’t work:</p>

```c++
auto fp = &string::empty;   // fp points to the string empty function
// error: must use .* or ->* to call a pointer to member
find_if(svec.begin(), svec.end(), fp);
```

<p>The <code>find_if</code> algorithm expects a callable object, but we’ve supplied <code>fp</code>, which is a pointer to a member function. This call won’t compile, because the code inside <code>find_if</code> executes a statement something like</p>

```c++
// check whether the given predicate applied to the current element yields true
if (fp(*it))  // error: must use ->* to call through a pointer to member
```

<p>which attempts to call the object it was passed.</p>
<h5>Using <code>function</code> to Generate a Callable</h5>
<p>One way to obtain a callable from a pointer to member function is by using the library <code>function</code> template (§ <a href="137-14.8._functioncall_operator.html#filepos3690557">14.8.3</a>, p. <a href="137-14.8._functioncall_operator.html#filepos3690557">577</a>):</p>

```c++
function<bool (const string&)> fcn = &string::empty;
find_if(svec.begin(), svec.end(), fcn);
```

<p>Here we tell <code>function</code> that <code>empty</code> is a function that can be called with a <code>string</code> and returns a <code>bool</code>. Ordinarily, the object on which a member function executes is passed to the implicit <code>this</code> parameter. When we want to use <code>function</code> to generate a callable for a member function, we have to “translate” the code to make that implicit parameter explicit.</p>
<p>When a <code>function</code> object holds a pointer to a member function, the <code>function</code> class knows that it must use the appropriate pointer-to-member operator to make the call. That is, we can imagine that <code>find_if</code> will have code something like</p>

```c++
// assuming it is the iterator inside find_if, so *it is an object in the given range
if (fcn(*it))  // assuming fcn is the name of the callable inside find_if
```

<p>which <code>function</code> will execute using the proper pointer-to-member operator. In essence, the <code>function</code> class will transform this call into something like</p>

```c++
// assuming it is the iterator inside find_if, so *it is an object in the given range
if (((*it).*p)()) // assuming p is the pointer to member function inside fcn
```

<p>When we define a <code>function</code> object, we must specify the function type that is the signature of the callable objects that object can represent. When the callable is a member function, the signature’s first parameter must represent the (normally implicit) object on which the member will be run. The signature we give to <code>function</code> must specify whether the object will be passed as a pointer or a reference.</p>
<p>When we defined <code>fcn</code>, we knew that we wanted to call <code>find_if</code> on a sequence of <code>string</code> objects. Hence, we asked <code>function</code> to generate a callable that took <code>string</code> objects. Had our <code>vector</code> held pointers to <code>string</code>, we would have told <code>function</code> to expect a pointer:</p>
<p><a id="filepos5276101"></a></p>

```c++
vector<string*> pvec;
function<bool (const string*)> fp = &string::empty;
// fp takes a pointer to string and uses the ->* to call empty
find_if(pvec.begin(), pvec.end(), fp);
```

<h5>Using <code>mem_fn</code> to Generate a Callable</h5>
<a id="filepos5277269"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>To use <code>function</code>, we must supply the call signature of the member we want to call. We can, instead, let the compiler deduce the member’s type by using another library facility, <code>mem_fn</code>, which, like <code>function</code>, is defined in the <code>functional</code> header. Like <code>function, mem_fn</code> generates a callable object from a pointer to member. Unlike <code>function, mem_fn</code> will deduce the type of the callable from the type of the pointer to member:</p>

```c++
find_if(svec.begin(), svec.end(), mem_fn(&string::empty));
```

<p>Here we used <code>mem_fn(&amp;string::empty)</code> to generate a callable object that takes a <code>string</code> argument and returns a <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>The callable generated by <code>mem_fn</code> can be called on either an object or a pointer:</p>

```c++
auto f = mem_fn(&string::empty); // f takes a string or a string*
f(*svec.begin()); // ok: passes a string object; f uses .* to call empty
f(&svec[0]);      // ok: passes a pointer to string; f uses .-> to call empty
```

<p>Effectively, we can think of <code>mem_fn</code>
<em>as if</em> it generates a callable with an overloaded function call operator—one that takes a <code>string*</code> and the other a <code>string&amp;</code>.</p>
<h5>Using <code>bind</code> to Generate a Callable</h5>
<p>For completeness, we can also use <code>bind</code> (§ <a href="100-10.3._customizing_operations.html#filepos2586884">10.3.4</a>, p. <a href="100-10.3._customizing_operations.html#filepos2586884">397</a>) to generate a callable from a member function:</p>

```c++
// bind each string in the range to the implicit first argument to empty
auto it = find_if(svec.begin(), svec.end(),
                  bind(&string::empty, _1));
```

<p>As with <code>function</code>, when we use <code>bind</code>, we must make explicit the member function’s normally implicit parameter that represents the object on which the member function will operate. Like <code>mem_fn</code>, the first argument to the callable generated by <code>bind</code> can be either a pointer or a reference to a <code>string</code>:</p>

```c++
auto f =  bind(&string::empty, _1);
f(*svec.begin()); // ok: argument is a string f will use .* to call empty
f(&svec[0]); // ok: argument is a pointer to string f will use .-> to call empty
```

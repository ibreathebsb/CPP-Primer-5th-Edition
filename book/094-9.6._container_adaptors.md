<h3 id="filepos2426063">9.6. Container Adaptors</h3>
<Badge type="danger" text="Advanced" />
<p>In addition to the sequential containers, the library defines three sequential container adaptors: <code>stack</code>, <code>queue</code>, and <code>priority_queue</code>. An <strong><a href="096-defined_terms.html#filepos2444892" id="filepos2426582">adaptor</a></strong> is a general <a id="filepos2426656"></a>concept in the library. There are container, iterator, and function adaptors. Essentially, an adaptor is a mechanism for making one thing act like another. A container adaptor takes an existing container type and makes it act like a different type. For example, the <code>stack</code> adaptor takes a sequential container (other than <code>array</code> or <code>forward_list)</code> and makes it operate as if it were a <code>stack</code>. <a href="094-9.6._container_adaptors.html#filepos2427490">Table 9.17</a> lists the operations and types that are common to all the container adaptors.</p>

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `size_type`              | Type large enough to hold the size of the largest object of this type.                                                                                          |

<p>Exercises Section 9.5.5</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 9.50:</strong> Write a program to process a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>s whose elements represent integral values. Produce the sum of all the elements in that <code>vector</code>. Change the program so that it sums of <code>string</code>s that represent floating-point values.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 9.51:</strong> Write a class that has three <code>unsigned</code> members representing year, month, and day. Write a constructor that takes a <code>string</code> representing a date. Your constructor should handle a variety of date formats, such as January 1, 1900, 1/1/1900, Jan 1, 1900, and so on.</p>

<h4>Defining an Adaptor</h4>
<p>Each adaptor defines two constructors: the default constructor that creates an empty object, and a constructor that takes a container and initializes the adaptor by copying the given container. For example, assuming that <code>deq</code> is a <code>deque&lt;int&gt;</code>, we can use <code>deq</code> to initialize a new <code>stack</code> as follows:</p>

```c++
stack<int> stk(deq);  // copies elements from deq into stk
```

<p>By default both <code>stack</code> and <code>queue</code> are implemented in terms of <code>deque</code>, and a <code>priority_queue</code> is implemented on a <code>vector</code>. We can override the default container type by naming a sequential container as a second type argument when we create the adaptor:</p>
<p><a id="filepos2430935"></a></p>

```c++
// empty stack implemented on top of vector
stack<string, vector<string>> str_stk;
// str_stk2 is implemented on top of vector and initially holds a copy of svec
stack<string, vector<string>> str_stk2(svec);
```

<p>There are constraints on which containers can be used for a given adaptor. All of the adaptors require the ability to add and remove elements. As a result, they cannot be built on an <code>array</code>. Similarly, we cannot use <code>forward_list</code>, because all of the adaptors require operations that add, remove, or access the last element in the container. A <code>stack</code> requires only <code>push_back, pop_back</code>, and <code>back</code> operations, so we can use any of the remaining container types for a <code>stack</code>. The <code>queue</code> adaptor requires <code>back, push_back, front</code>, and <code>push_front</code>, so it can be built on a <code>list</code> or <code>deque</code> but not on a <code>vector</code>. A <code>priority_queue</code> requires random access in addition to the <code>front, push_back</code>, and <code>pop_back</code> operations; it can be built on a <code>vector</code> or a <code>deque</code> but not on a <code>list</code>.</p>
<h4>Stack Adaptor</h4>
<p>The <code>stack</code> type is defined in the <code>stack</code> header. The operations provided by a <code>stack</code> are listed in <a href="094-9.6._container_adaptors.html#filepos2435976">Table 9.18</a>. The following program illustrates the use of <code>stack</code>:</p>

```c++
stack<int> intStack;  // empty stack
// fill up the stack
for (size_t ix = 0; ix != 10; ++ix)
    intStack.push(ix);   // intStackholds 0 ... 9 inclusive
while (!intStack.empty()) {    // while there are still values in intStack
    int value = intStack.top();
    // code that uses value
    intStack.pop(); // pop the top element, and repeat
}
```

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `s.pop()`                        | Removes, but does not return, the top element from the `stack`.                                                 |
| `s.push(item)` `s.emplace(args)` | Creates a new top element on the stack by copying or moving `item`, or by constructing the element from `args`. |
| `s.top()`                        | Returns, but does not remove, the top element on the `stack`.                                                   |

<p>The declaration</p>

```c++
stack<int> intStack;  // empty stack
```

<p>defines <code>intStack</code> to be an empty <code>stack</code> that holds integer elements. The <code>for</code> loop adds ten elements, initializing each to the next integer in sequence starting from zero. The <code>while</code> loop iterates through the entire <code>stack</code>, examining the <code>top</code> value and <code>pop</code>ping it from the <code>stack</code> until the <code>stack</code> is empty.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2437640"></a>Each container adaptor defines its own operations in terms of operations provided by the underlying container type. We can use only the adaptor operations and cannot use the operations of the underlying container type. For example,</p>

```c++
intStack.push(ix);   // intStackholds 0 ... 9 inclusive
```

<p>calls <code>push_back</code> on the <code>deque</code> object on which <code>intStack</code> is based. Although <code>stack</code> is implemented by using a <code>deque</code>, we have no direct access to the <code>deque</code> operations. We cannot call <code>push_back</code> on a <code>stack;</code> instead, we must use the <code>stack</code> operation named <code>push</code>.</p>
<h4>The Queue Adaptors</h4>
<p>The <code>queue</code> and <code>priority_queue</code> adaptors are defined in the <code>queue</code> header. <a href="094-9.6._container_adaptors.html#filepos2439875">Table 9.19</a> lists the operations supported by these types.</p>

* By default `queue` uses `deque` and `priority_queue` uses `vector`.
* `queue` can use a `list` or `vector` as well, `priority_queue` can use a `deque`.

| `q.pop()`                        | Removes, but does not return, the front element or highest-priority element from the `queue` or `priority_queue`, respectively.              |
| `q.front()`  `q.back()`          | Returns, but does not remove, the front or back element of `q`. **Valid only for `queue`.**                                                  |
| `q.top()`                        | Returns, but does not remove, the highest-priority element. **Valid only for `priority_queue`.**                                             |
| `q.push(item)` `q.emplace(args)` | Create an element with value `item` or constructed from `args` at the end of the `queue` or in its appropriate position in `priority_queue`. |


<p>The library <code>queue</code> uses a first-in, first-out (FIFO) storage and retrieval policy. Objects entering the queue are placed in the back and objects leaving the queue are removed from the front. A restaurant that seats people in the order in which they arrive is an example of a FIFO queue.</p>
<p>A <code>priority_queue</code> lets us establish a priority among the elements held in the queue. Newly added elements are placed ahead of all the elements with a lower priority. A restaurant that seats people according to their reservation time, regardless of when they arrive, is an example of a priority queue. By default, the library uses the <code>&lt;</code> operator on the element type to determine relative priorities. We’ll learn how to override this default in § <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2751456">11.2.2</a> (p. <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2751456">425</a>).</p>

When you see a close parenthesis after an open parenthesis, <code>pop</code> elements down to and including the open parenthesis off the <code>stack</code>. <code>push</code> a value onto the <code>stack</code> to indicate that a parenthesized expression was replaced.</p>

<p>Types are fundamental to all programming in C++.</p>
<p>Each type defines the storage requirements and the operations that may be performed on objects of that type. The language provides a set of fundamental built-in types such as <code>int</code> and <code>char</code>, which are closely tied to their representation on the machineâ€™s hardware. Types can be non<code>const</code> or <code>const;</code> a <code>const</code> object must be initialized and, once initialized, its value may not be changed. In addition, we can define compound types, such as pointers or references. A compound type is one that is defined in terms of another type.</p>
<p>The language lets us define our own types by defining classes. The library uses the class facility to provide a set of higher-level abstractions such as the IO and <code>string</code> types.</p>

<h3 id="filepos2347166">9.4. How a <code>vector</code> Grows</h3>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>To support fast random access, <code>vector</code> elements are stored contiguously—each element is adjacent to the previous element. Ordinarily, we should not care about how a library type is implemented; all we should care about is how to use it. However, in the case of <code>vector</code>s and <code>string</code>s, part of the implementation leaks into its interface.</p>
<p>Given that elements are contiguous, and that the size of the container is flexible, consider what must happen when we add an element to a <code>vector</code> or a <code>string</code>: If there is no room for the new element, the container can’t just add an element somewhere else in memory—the elements must be contiguous. Instead, the container must allocate new memory to hold the existing elements plus the new one, move the elements from the old location into the new space, add the new element, and deallocate the old memory. If <code>vector</code> did this memory allocation and deallocation each time we added an element, performance would be unacceptably slow.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 9.31:</strong> The program on page <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2335296">354</a> to remove even-valued elements and duplicate odd ones will not work on a <code>list</code> or <code>forward_list</code>. Why? Revise the program so that it works on these types as well.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 9.32:</strong> In the program onpage <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2335296">354</a> would it be legal to write the call to <code>insert</code> as follows? If not, why not?</p>

```c++
iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);
```

<p><strong>Exercise 9.33:</strong> In the final example in this section what would happen if we did not assign the result of <code>insert</code> to <code>begin</code>? Write a program that omits this assignment to see if your expectation was correct.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 9.34:</strong> Assuming <code>vi</code> is a container of <code>int</code>s that includes even and odd values, predict the behavior of the following loop. After you’ve analyzed this loop, write a program to test whether your expectations were correct.</p>

```c++
iter = vi.begin();
while (iter != vi.end())
    if (*iter % 2)
        iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);
    ++iter;
```

<p>To avoid these costs, library implementors use allocation strategies that reduce the number of times the container is reallocated. When they have to get new memory, <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> implementations typically allocate capacity beyond what is immediately needed. The container holds this storage in reserve and uses it to allocate new elements as they are added. Thus, there is no need to reallocate the container for each new element.</p>
<p>This allocation strategy is dramatically more efficient than reallocating the container each time an element is added. In fact, its performance is good enough that in practice a <code>vector</code> usually grows more efficiently than a <code>list</code> or a <code>deque</code>, even though the <code>vector</code> has to move all of its elements each time it reallocates memory.</p>
<h4>Members to Manage Capacity</h4>
<p>The <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> types provide members, described in <a href="092-9.4._how_a_vector_grows.html#filepos2353756">Table 9.10</a>, that let us interact with the memory-allocation part of the implementation. The <code>capacity</code> operation tells us how many elements the container can hold before it must allocate more space. The <code>reserve</code> operation lets us tell the container how many elements it should be prepared to hold.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p><code>reserve</code> does not change the number of elements in the container; it affects only how much memory the <code>vector</code> preallocates.</p>
:::

<p>A call to <code>reserve</code> changes the capacity of the <code>vector</code> only if the requested space exceeds the current capacity. If the requested size is greater than the current <a id="filepos2354820"></a>capacity, <code>reserve</code> allocates at least as much as (and may allocate more than) the requested amount.</p>
<p>If the requested size is less than or equal to the existing capacity, <code>reserve</code> does nothing. In particular, calling <code>reserve</code> with a size smaller than <code>capacity</code> does not cause the container to give back memory. Thus, after calling <code>reserve</code>, the <code>capacity</code> will be greater than or equal to the argument passed to <code>reserve</code>.</p>
<p>As a result, a call to <code>reserve</code> will never reduce the amount of space that the container uses. Similarly, the <code>resize</code> members (§ <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2327136">9.3.5</a>, p. <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2327136">352</a>) change only the number of elements in the container, not its capacity. We cannot use <code>resize</code> to reduce the memory a container holds in reserve.</p>
<a id="filepos2356389"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>Under the new library, we can call <code>shrink_to_fit</code> to ask a <code>deque, vector</code>, or <code>string</code> to return unneeded memory. This function indicates that we no longer need any excess capacity. However, the implementation is free to ignore this request. There is no guarantee that a call to <code>shrink_to_fit</code> will return memory.</p>
<h4><code>capacity</code> and <code>size</code></h4>
<p>It is important to understand the difference between <code>capacity</code> and <code>size</code>. The <code>size</code> of a container is the number of elements it already holds; its <code>capacity</code> is how many elements it can hold before more space must be allocated.</p>
<p>The following code illustrates the interaction between <code>size</code> and <code>capacity</code>:</p>

```c++
vector<int> ivec;
// size should be zero; capacity is implementation defined
cout << "ivec: size: " << ivec.size()
     << " capacity: "  << ivec.capacity() << endl;
// give ivec 24 elements
for (vector<int>::size_type ix = 0; ix != 24; ++ix)
     ivec.push_back(ix);

// size should be 24; capacity will be >= 24 and is implementation defined
cout << "ivec: size: " << ivec.size()
     << " capacity: "  << ivec.capacity() << endl;
```

<p>When run on our system, this code produces the following output:</p>

```
ivec: size: 0 capacity: 0
ivec: size: 24 capacity: 32
```

<p>We know that the <code>size</code> of an empty <code>vector</code> is zero, and evidently our library also sets the <code>capacity</code> of an empty <code>vector</code> to zero. When we add elements to the <code>vector</code>, we know that the <code>size</code> is the same as the number of elements we’ve added. The <code>capacity</code> must be at least as large as <code>size</code> but can be larger. The details of how much excess capacity is allocated vary by implementations of the library. Under this implementation, adding 24 elements one at a time results in a <code>capacity</code> of 32.</p>
<p>Visually we can think of the current state of <code>ivec</code> as</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00058.jpg"/>
<p>We can now <code>reserve</code> some additional space:</p>

```c++
ivec.reserve(50); // sets capacity to at least 50; might be more
// size should be 24; capacity will be >= 50 and is implementation defined
cout << "ivec: size: " << ivec.size()
     << " capacity: "  << ivec.capacity() << endl;
```

<p>Here, the output indicates that the call to <code>reserve</code> allocated exactly as much space as we requested:</p>

```
ivec: size: 24 capacity: 50
```

<p>We might next use up that reserved capacity as follows:</p>

```c++
// add elements to use up the excess capacity
while (ivec.size() != ivec.capacity())
     ivec.push_back(0);
// capacity should be unchanged and size and capacity are now equal
cout << "ivec: size: " << ivec.size()
     << " capacity: "  << ivec.capacity() << endl;
```

<p>The output indicates that at this point we’ve used up the reserved capacity, and <code>size</code> and <code>capacity</code> are equal:</p>

```
ivec: size: 50 capacity: 50
```

<p>Because we used only reserved capacity, there is no need for the <code>vector</code> to do any allocation. In fact, as long as no operation exceeds the <code>vector</code>’s capacity, the <code>vector</code> must not reallocate its elements.</p>
<p>If we now add another element, the <code>vector</code> will have to reallocate itself:</p>

```c++
ivec.push_back(42); // add one more element
// size should be 51; capacity will be >= 51 and is implementation defined
cout << "ivec: size: " << ivec.size()
     << " capacity: "  << ivec.capacity() << endl;
```

<p>The output from this portion of the program</p>

```
ivec: size: 51 capacity: 100
```

<p>indicates that this <code>vector</code> implementation appears to follow a strategy of doubling the current capacity each time it has to allocate new storage.</p>
<p>We can call <code>shrink_to_fit</code> to ask that memory beyond what is needed for the current size be returned to the system:</p>

```c++
ivec.shrink_to_fit(); // ask for the memory to be returned
// size should be unchanged; capacity is implementation defined
cout << "ivec: size: " << ivec.size()
     << " capacity: "  << ivec.capacity() << endl;
```

<p>Calling <code>shrink_to_fit</code> is only a request; there is no guarantee that the library will return the memory.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>Each <code>vector</code> implementation can choose its own allocation strategy. However, it must not allocate new memory until it is forced to do so.</p>
:::

<p>A <code>vector</code> may be reallocated only when the user performs an insert operation when the <code>size</code> equals <code>capacity</code> or by a call to <code>resize</code> or <code>reserve</code> with a value that exceeds the current <code>capacity</code>. How much memory is allocated beyond the specified amount is up to the implementation.</p>
<p>Every implementation is required to follow a strategy that ensures that it is efficient to use <code>push_back</code> to add elements to a <code>vector</code>. Technically speaking, the execution time of creating an <em>n</em>-element <code>vector</code> by calling <code>push_back</code>
<em>n</em> times on an initially empty <code>vector</code> must never be more than a constant multiple of <em>n</em>.</p>

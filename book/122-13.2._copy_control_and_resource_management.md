<h3 id="filepos3281447">13.2. Copy Control and Resource Management</h3>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Ordinarily, classes that manage resources that do not reside in the class must define the copy-control members. As we saw in § <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3244603">13.1.4</a> (p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3244603">504</a>), such classes will need destructors to free the resources allocated by the object. Once a class needs a destructor, it almost surely needs a copy constructor and copy-assignment operator as well.</p>
<p>In order to define these members, we first have to decide what copying an object of our type will mean. In general, we have two choices: We can define the copy operations to make the class behave like a value or like a pointer.</p>
<p>Classes that behave like values have their own state. When we copy a valuelike object, the copy and the original are independent of each other. Changes made to the copy have no effect on the original, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Classes that act like pointers share state. When we copy objects of such classes, the copy and the original use the same underlying data. Changes made to the copy also change the original, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Of the library classes we’ve used, the library containers and <code>string</code> class have valuelike behavior. Not surprisingly, the <code>shared_ptr</code> class provides pointerlike behavior, as does our <code>StrBlob</code> class (§ <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2907541">12.1.1</a>, p. <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2907541">456</a>). The IO types and <code>unique_ptr</code> do not allow copying or assignment, so they provide neither valuelike nor pointerlike behavior.</p>
<p>To illustrate these two approaches, we’ll define the copy-control members for the <code>HasPtr</code> class used in the exercises. First, we’ll make the class act like a value; then we’ll reimplement the class making it behave like a pointer.</p>
<p>Our <code>HasPtr</code> class has two members, an <code>int</code> and a pointer to <code>string</code>. Ordinarily, classes copy members of built-in type (other than pointers) directly; such members are values and hence ordinarily ought to behave like values. What we do when we copy the pointer member determines whether a class like <code>HasPtr</code> has valuelike or pointerlike behavior.</p>

::: info
<p>Exercises Section 13.2</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 13.22:</strong> Assume that we want <code>HasPtr</code> to behave like a value. That is, each object should have its own copy of the <code>string</code> to which the objects point. We’ll show the definitions of the copy-control members in the next section. However, you already know everything you need to know to implement these members. Write the <code>HasPtr</code> copy constructor and copy-assignment operator before reading on.</p>

<h4 id="filepos3285596">13.2.1. Classes That Act Like Values</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>To provide valuelike behavior, each object has to have its own copy of the resource that the class manages. That means each <code>HasPtr</code> object must have its own copy of the <code>string</code> to which <code>ps</code> points. To implement valuelike behavior <code>HasPtr</code> needs</p>
<ul><li>A copy constructor that copies the <code>string</code>, not just the pointer</li><li>A destructor to free the <code>string</code></li><li>A copy-assignment operator to free the object’s existing <code>string</code> and copy the <code>string</code> from its right-hand operand</li></ul>

<p>The valuelike version of <code>HasPtr</code> is</p>

```c++
class HasPtr {
public:
    HasPtr(const std::string &s = std::string()):
        ps(new std::string(s)), i(0) { }
    // each HasPtr has its own copy of the string to which ps points
    HasPtr(const HasPtr &p):
        ps(new std::string(*p.ps)), i(p.i) { }
    HasPtr& operator=(const HasPtr &);
    ~HasPtr() { delete ps; }
private:
    std::string *ps;
    int    i;
};
```

<p><a id="filepos3288692"></a>Our class is simple enough that we’ve defined all but the assignment operator in the class body. The first constructor takes an (optional) <code>string</code> argument. That constructor dynamically allocates its own copy of that <code>string</code> and stores a pointer to that <code>string</code> in <code>ps</code>. The copy constructor also allocates its own, separate copy of the <code>string</code>. The destructor frees the memory allocated in its constructors by executing <code>delete</code> on the pointer member, <code>ps</code>.</p>
<h5>Valuelike Copy-Assignment Operator</h5>
<p>Assignment operators typically combine the actions of the destructor and the copy constructor. Like the destructor, assignment destroys the left-hand operand’s resources. Like the copy constructor, assignment copies data from the right-hand operand. However, it is crucially important that these actions be done in a sequence that is correct even if an object is assigned to itself. Moreover, when possible, we should also write our assignment operators so that they will leave the left-hand operand in a sensible state should an exception occur (§ <a href="059-5.6._try_blocks_and_exception_handling.html#filepos1377241">5.6.2</a>, p. <a href="059-5.6._try_blocks_and_exception_handling.html#filepos1377241">196</a>).</p>
<p>In this case, we can handle self-assignment—and make our code safe should an exception happen—by first copying the right-hand side. After the copy is made, we’ll free the left-hand side and update the pointer to point to the newly allocated <code>string</code>:</p>

```c++
HasPtr& HasPtr::operator=(const HasPtr &rhs)
{
    auto newp = new string(*rhs.ps);   // copy the underlying string
    delete ps;       // free the old memory
    ps = newp;       // copy data from rhs into this object
    i = rhs.i;
    return *this;    // return this object
}
```

<p>In this assignment operator, we quite clearly first do the work of the constructor: The initializer of <code>newp</code> is identical to the initializer of <code>ps</code> in <code>HasPtr</code>’s copy constructor. As in the destructor, we next <code>delete</code> the <code>string</code> to which <code>ps</code> currently points. What remains is to copy the pointer to the newly allocated <code>string</code> and the <code>int</code> value from <code>rhs</code> into this object.</p>

::: info
<p>Key Concept: Assignment Operators</p>
<p>There are two points to keep in mind when you write an assignment operator:</p>
<p>• Assignment operators must work correctly if an object is assigned to itself.</p>
<p>• Most assignment operators share work with the destructor and copy constructor.</p>
<p>A good pattern to use when you write an assignment operator is to first copy the right-hand operand into a local temporary. <em>After</em> the copy is done, it is safe to destroy the existing members of the left-hand operand. Once the left-hand operand is destroyed, copy the data from the temporary into the members of the left-hand operand.</p>
:::

<p>To illustrate the importance of guarding against self-assignment, consider what would happen if we wrote the assignment operator as</p>

```c++
// WRONG way to write an assignment operator!
HasPtr&
HasPtr::operator=(const HasPtr &rhs)
{
    delete ps;   // frees the string to which this object points
    // if rhs and *this are the same object, we're copying from deleted memory!
    ps = new string(*(rhs.ps));
    i = rhs.i;
    return *this;
}
```

<p>If <code>rhs</code> and this object are the same object, deleting <code>ps</code> frees the <code>string</code> to which both <code>*this</code> and <code>rhs</code> point. When we attempt to copy <code>* (rhs.ps)</code> in the <code>new</code> expression, that pointer points to invalid memory. What happens is undefined.</p>

::: warning
<p>It is crucially important for assignment operators to work correctly, even when an object is assigned to itself. A good way to do so is to copy the right-hand operand before destroying the left-hand operand.</p>

:::

<h4 id="filepos3299202">13.2.2. Defining Classes That Act Like Pointers</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>For our <code>HasPtr</code> class to act like a pointer, we need the copy constructor and copy-assignment operator to copy the pointer member, not the <code>string</code> to which that pointer points. Our class will still need its own destructor to free the memory allocated by the constructor that takes a <code>string</code> (§ <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3244603">13.1.4</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3244603">504</a>). In this case, though, the destructor cannot unilaterally free its associated <code>string</code>. It can do so only when the last <code>HasPtr</code> pointing to that <code>string</code> goes away.</p>
<p>The easiest way to make a class act like a pointer is to use <code>shared_ptr</code>s to manage the resources in the class. Copying (or assigning) a <code>shared_ptr</code> copies <a id="filepos3300661"></a>(assigns) the pointer to which the <code>shared_ptr</code> points. The <code>shared_ptr</code> class itself keeps track of how many users are sharing the pointed-to object. When there are no more users, the <code>shared_ptr</code> class takes care of freeing the resource.</p>
<p>However, sometimes we want to manage a resource directly. In such cases, it can be useful to use a <strong><a href="128-defined_terms.html#filepos3541341" id="filepos3301263">reference count</a></strong> (§ <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2907541">12.1.1</a>, p. <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2907541">452</a>). To show how reference counting works, we’ll redefine <code>HasPtr</code> to provide pointerlike behavior, but we will do our own reference counting.</p>
<h5>Reference Counts</h5>
<p>Reference counting works as follows:</p>
<ul><li>In addition to initializing the object, each constructor (other than the copy constructor) creates a counter. This counter will keep track of how many objects share state with the object we are creating. When we create an object, there is only one such object, so we initialize the counter to 1.</li><li>The copy constructor does not allocate a new counter; instead, it copies the data members of its given object, including the counter. The copy constructor increments this shared counter, indicating that there is another user of that object’s state.</li><li>The destructor decrements the counter, indicating that there is one less user of the shared state. If the count goes to zero, the destructor deletes that state.</li><li>The copy-assignment operator increments the right-hand operand’s counter and decrements the counter of the left-hand operand. If the counter for the left-hand operand goes to zero, there are no more users. In this case, the copy-assignment operator must destroy the state of the left-hand operand.</li></ul>

<p>The only wrinkle is deciding where to put the reference count. The counter cannot be a direct member of a <code>HasPtr</code> object. To see why, consider what happens in the following example:</p>

```c++
HasPtr p1("Hiya!");
HasPtr p2(p1);  // p1 and p2 point to the same string
HasPtr p3(p1);  // p1, p2, and p3 all point to the same string
```

<p>If the reference count is stored in each object, how can we update it correctly when <code>p3</code> is created? We could increment the count in <code>p1</code> and copy that count into <code>p3</code>, but how would we update the counter in <code>p2?</code></p>
<p>One way to solve this problem is to store the counter in dynamic memory. When we create an object, we’ll also allocate a new counter. When we copy or assign an object, we’ll copy the pointer to the counter. That way the copy and the original will point to the same counter.</p>
<h5>Defining a Reference-Counted Class</h5>
<p>Using a reference count, we can write the pointerlike version of <code>HasPtr</code> as follows:</p>
<p><a id="filepos3306070"></a></p>

```c++
class HasPtr {
public:
    // constructor allocates a new string and a new counter, which it sets to 1
    HasPtr(const std::string &s = std::string()):
      ps(new std::string(s)), i(0), use(new std::size_t(1)) {}
    // copy constructor copies all three data members and increments the counter
    HasPtr(const HasPtr &p):
        ps(p.ps), i(p.i), use(p.use) { ++*use; }
    HasPtr& operator=(const HasPtr&);
    ~HasPtr();
private:
    std::string *ps;
    int    i;
    std::size_t *use;   // member to keep track of how many objects share *ps
};
```

<p>Here, we’ve added a new data member named <code>use</code> that will keep track of how many objects share the same <code>string</code>. The constructor that takes a <code>string</code> allocates this counter and initializes it to <code>1</code>, indicating that there is one user of this object’s <code>string</code> member.</p>
<h5>Pointerlike Copy Members “Fiddle” the Reference Count</h5>
<p>When we copy or assign a <code>HasPtr</code> object, we want the copy and the original to point to the same <code>string</code>. That is, when we copy a <code>HasPtr</code>, we’ll copy <code>ps</code> itself, not the <code>string</code> to which <code>ps</code> points. When we make a copy, we also increment the counter associated with that <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>The copy constructor (which we defined inside the class) copies all three members from its given <code>HasPtr</code>. This constructor also increments the <code>use</code> member, indicating that there is another user for the <code>string</code> to which <code>ps</code> and <code>p.ps</code> point.</p>
<p>The destructor cannot unconditionally <code>delete ps</code>—there might be other objects pointing to that memory. Instead, the destructor decrements the reference count, indicating that one less object shares the <code>string</code>. If the counter goes to zero, then the destructor frees the memory to which both <code>ps</code> and <code>use</code> point:</p>

```c++
HasPtr::~HasPtr()
{
    if (--*use == 0) {    // if the reference count goes to 0
        delete ps;        // delete the string
        delete use;       // and the counter
    }
}
```

<p>The copy-assignment operator, as usual, does the work common to the copy constructor and to the destructor. That is, the assignment operator must increment the counter of the right-hand operand (i.e., the work of the copy constructor) and decrement the counter of the left-hand operand, deleting the memory used if appropriate (i.e., the work of the destructor).</p>
<p>Also, as usual, the operator must handle self-assignment. We do so by incrementing the count in <code>rhs</code> before decrementing the count in the left-hand object. <a id="filepos3312210"></a>That way if both objects are the same, the counter will have been incremented before we check to see if <code>ps</code> (and <code>use</code>) should be deleted:</p>

```c++
HasPtr& HasPtr::operator=(const HasPtr &rhs)
{
    ++*rhs.use;  // increment the use count of the right-hand operand
    if (--*use == 0) {  // then decrement this object's counter
        delete ps;      // if no other users
        delete use;     // free this object's allocated members
    }
    ps = rhs.ps;        // copy data from rhs into this object
    i = rhs.i;
    use = rhs.use;
    return *this;       // return this object
}
```

<p>Among the most important library types are <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code>. A <code>string</code> is a variable-length sequence of characters, and a <code>vector</code> is a container of objects of a single type.</p>
<p>Iterators allow indirect access to objects stored in a container. Iterators are used to access and navigate between the elements in <code>string</code>s and <code>vector</code>s.</p>
<p>Arrays and pointers to array elements provide low-level analogs to the <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> libraries. In general, the library classes should be used in preference to low-level array and pointer alternatives built into the language.</p>

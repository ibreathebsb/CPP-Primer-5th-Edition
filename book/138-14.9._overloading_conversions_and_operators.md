<p>In § <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1990205">7.5.4</a> (p. <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1990205">294</a>) we saw that a non<code>explicit</code> constructor that can be called with one argument defines an implicit conversion. Such constructors convert an object from the argument’s type <em>to</em> the class type. We can also define conversions <em>from</em> the class type. We define a conversion from a class type by defining a conversion <a id="filepos3713754"></a>operator. Converting constructors and conversion operators define <strong><a href="140-defined_terms.html#filepos3775553" id="filepos3713836">class-type conversions</a></strong>. Such conversions are also referred to as <strong><a href="140-defined_terms.html#filepos3778805" id="filepos3713962">user-defined conversions</a></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos3714067">14.9.1. Conversion Operators</h4>
<p>A <strong><a href="140-defined_terms.html#filepos3776100" id="filepos3714207">conversion operator</a></strong> is a special kind of member function that converts a value of a class type to a value of some other type. A conversion function typically has the general form</p>

```c++
operator type() const;
```

<p>where <em>type</em> represents a type. Conversion operators can be defined for any type (other than <code>void</code>) that can be a function return type (§ <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1415571">6.1</a>, p. <a href="063-6.1._function_basics.html#filepos1415571">204</a>). Conversions to an array or a function type are not permitted. Conversions to pointer types—both data and function pointers—and to reference types are allowed.</p>
<p>Conversion operators have no explicitly stated return type and no parameters, and they must be defined as member functions. Conversion operations ordinarily should not change the object they are converting. As a result, conversion operators usually should be defined as <code>const</code> members.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>A conversion function must be a member function, may not specify a return type, and must have an empty parameter list. The function usually should be <code>const</code>.</p>
:::

<h5>Defining a Class with a Conversion Operator</h5>
<p>As an example, we’ll define a small class that represents an integer in the range of 0 to 255:</p>

```c++
class SmallInt {
public:
    SmallInt(int i = 0): val(i)
    {
        if (i < 0 || i > 255)
            throw std::out_of_range("Bad SmallInt value");
    }
    operator int() const { return val; }
private:
    std::size_t val;
};
```

<p>Our <code>SmallInt</code> class defines conversions <em>to</em> and <em>from</em> its type. The constructor converts values of arithmetic type to a <code>SmallInt</code>. The conversion operator converts <code>SmallInt</code> objects to <code>int</code>:</p>

```c++
SmallInt si;
si = 4; // implicitly converts 4 to SmallInt then calls SmallInt::operator=
si + 3; // implicitly converts si to int followed by integer addition
```

<p><a id="filepos3718929"></a>Although the compiler will apply only one user-defined conversion at a time (§ <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1178431">4.11.2</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1178431">162</a>), an implicit user-defined conversion can be preceded or followed by a standard (built-in) conversion (§ <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1162796">4.11.1</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1162796">159</a>). As a result, we can pass any arithmetic type to the <code>SmallInt</code> constructor. Similarly, we can use the converion operator to convert a <code>SmallInt</code> to an <code>int</code> and then convert the resulting <code>int</code> value to another arithmetic type:</p>

```c++
// the double argument is converted to int using the built-in conversion
SmallInt si = 3.14; // calls the SmallInt(int) constructor
// the SmallInt conversion operator converts si to int;
si + 3.14; // that int is converted to double using the built-in conversion
```

<p>Because conversion operators are implicitly applied, there is no way to pass arguments to these functions. Hence, conversion operators may not be defined to take parameters. Although a conversion function does not specify a return type, each conversion function must return a value of its corresponding type:</p>

```c++
class SmallInt;
operator int(SmallInt&);                 // error: nonmember
class SmallInt {
public:
    int operator int() const;            // error: return type
    operator int(int = 0) const;         // error: parameter list
    operator int*() const { return 42; } // error: 42 is not a pointer
};
```

::: info
<p>Caution: Avoid Overuse of Conversion Functions</p>
<p>As with using overloaded operators, judicious use of conversion operators can greatly simplify the job of a class designer and make using a class easier. However, some conversions can be misleading. Conversion operators are misleading when there is no obvious single mapping between the class type and the conversion type.</p>
<p>For example, consider a class that represents a <code>Date</code>. We might think it would be a good idea to provide a conversion from <code>Date</code> to <code>int</code>. However, what value should the conversion function return? The function might return a decimal representation of the year, month, and day. For example, July 30, 1989 might be represented as the <code>int</code> value 19800730. Alternatively, the conversion operator might return an <code>int</code> representing the number of days that have elapsed since some epoch point, such as January 1, 1970. Both these conversions have the desirable property that later dates correspond to larger integers, and so either might be useful.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is no single one-to-one mapping between an object of type <code>Date</code> and a value of type <code>int</code>. In such cases, it is better not to define the conversion operator. Instead, the class ought to define one or more ordinary members to extract the information in these various forms.</p>
:::

<h5>Conversion Operators Can Yield Suprising Results</h5>
<p>In practice, classes rarely provide conversion operators. Too often users are more likely to be surprised if a conversion happens automatically than to be helped by <a id="filepos3725848"></a>the existence of the conversion. However, there is one important exception to this rule of thumb: It is not uncommon for classes to define conversions to <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>Under earlier versions of the standard, classes that wanted to define a conversion to <code>bool</code> faced a problem: Because <code>bool</code> is an arithmetic type, a class-type object that is converted to <code>bool</code> can be used in any context where an arithmetic type is expected. Such conversions can happen in surprising ways. In particular, if <code>istream</code> had a conversion to <code>bool</code>, the following code would compile:</p>

```c++
int i = 42;
cin << i; // this code would be legal if the conversion to bool were not explicit!
```

<p>This program attempts to use the output operator on an input stream. There is no <code>&lt;&lt;</code> defined for <code>istream</code>, so the code is almost surely in error. However, this code could use the <code>bool</code> conversion operator to convert <code>cin</code> to <code>bool</code>. The resulting <code>bool</code> value would then be promoted to <code>int</code> and used as the left-hand operand to the built-in version of the left-shift operator. The promoted <code>bool</code> value (either 1 or 0) would be shifted left 42 positions.</p>
<h5><code>explicit</code> Conversion Operators</h5>
<a id="filepos3728715"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>To prevent such problems, the new standard introduced <a href="140-defined_terms.html#filepos3776999" id="filepos3728856"><code>explicit</code>
<strong>conversion operators</strong></a>:</p>

```c++
class SmallInt {
public:
    // the compiler won't automatically apply this conversion
    explicit operator int() const { return val; }
    // other members as before
};
```

<p>As with an <code>explicit</code> constructor (§ <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1990205">7.5.4</a>, p. <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1990205">296</a>), the compiler won’t (generally) use an <code>explicit</code> conversion operator for implicit conversions:</p>

```c++
SmallInt si = 3;  // ok: the SmallInt constructor is not explicit
si + 3; // error: implicit is conversion required, but operator int is explicit
static_cast<int>(si) + 3; // ok: explicitly request the conversion
```

<p>If the conversion operator is <code>explicit</code>, we can still do the conversion. However, with one exception, we must do so explicitly through a cast.</p>
<p>The exception is that the compiler will apply an <code>explicit</code> conversion to an expression used as a condition. That is, an <code>explicit</code> conversion will be used implicitly to convert an expression used as</p>
<ul><li>The condition of an <code>if, while</code>, or <code>do</code> statement</li><li>The condition expression in a <code>for</code> statement header</li><li>An operand to the logical <small>NOT</small> (<code>!</code>), <small>OR</small> (<code>||</code>), or <small>AND</small> (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) operators</li><li>The condition expression in a conditional <code>(?:</code>) operator</li></ul>

<h5><a id="filepos3733071"></a>Conversion to <code>bool</code></h5>
<p>In earlier versions of the library, the IO types defined a conversion to <code>void*</code>. They did so to avoid the kinds of problems illustrated above. Under the new standard, the IO library instead defines an <code>explicit</code> conversion to <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>Whenever we use a stream object in a condition, we use the <code>operator bool</code> that is defined for the IO types. For example,</p>

```c++
while (std::cin >> value)
```

<p>The condition in the <code>while</code> executes the input operator, which reads into <code>value</code> and returns <code>cin</code>. To evaluate the condition, <code>cin</code> is implicitly converted by the <code>istream operator bool</code> conversion function. That function returns <code>true</code> if the condition state of <code>cin</code> is <code>good</code> (§ <a href="083-8.1._the_io_classes.html#filepos2085669">8.1.2</a>, p. <a href="083-8.1._the_io_classes.html#filepos2085669">312</a>), and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Conversion to <code>bool</code> is usually intended for use in conditions. As a result, <code>operator bool</code> ordinarily should be defined as <code>explicit</code>.</p>

<h4 id="filepos3738144">14.9.2. Avoiding Ambiguous Conversions</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00010.jpg"/>
<p>If a class has one or more conversions, it is important to ensure that there is only one way to convert from the class type to the target type. If there is more than one way to perform a conversion, it will be hard to write unambiguous code.</p>
<p>There are two ways that multiple conversion paths can occur. The first happens when two classes provide mutual conversions. For example, mutual conversions exist when a class <code>A</code> defines a converting constructor that takes an object of class <code>B</code> and <code>B</code> itself defines a conversion operator to type <code>A</code>.</p>
<p><a id="filepos3739262"></a>The second way to generate multiple conversion paths is to define multiple conversions from or to types that are themselves related by conversions. The most obvious instance is the built-in arithmetic types. A given class ordinarily ought to define at most one conversion to or from an arithmetic type.</p>

::: warning
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Ordinarily, it is a bad idea to define classes with mutual conversions or to define conversions to or from two arithmetic types.</p>
:::

<h5>Argument Matching and Mutual Conversions</h5>
<p>In the following example, we’ve defined two ways to obtain an <code>A</code> from a <code>B</code>: either by using <code>B</code>’s conversion operator or by using the <code>A</code> constructor that takes a <code>B</code>:</p>

```c++
// usually a bad idea to have mutual conversions between two class types
struct B;
struct A {
    A() = default;
    A(const B&);        // converts a B to an A
    // other members
};
struct B {
    operator A() const; // also converts a B to an A
    // other members
};
A f(const A&);
B b;
A a = f(b); // error ambiguous: f(B::operator A())
            //          or f(A::A(const B&))
```

<p>Because there are two ways to obtain an <code>A</code> from a <code>B</code>, the compiler doesn’t know which conversion to run; the call to <code>f</code> is ambiguous. This call can use the <code>A</code> constructor that takes a <code>B</code>, or it can use the <code>B</code> conversion operator that converts a <code>B</code> to an <code>A</code>. Because these two functions are equally good, the call is in error.</p>
<p>If we want to make this call, we have to explicitly call the conversion operator or the constructor:</p>

```c++
A a1 = f(b.operator A()); // ok: use B's conversion operator
A a2 = f(A(b));           // ok: use A's constructor
```

<p>Note that we can’t resolve the ambiguity by using a cast—the cast itself would have the same ambiguity.</p>
<h5>Ambiguities and Multiple Conversions to Built-in Types</h5>
<p>Ambiguities also occur when a class defines multiple conversions to (or from) types that are themselves related by conversions. The easiest case to illustrate—and one that is particularly problematic—is when a class defines constructors from or conversions to more than one arithmetic type.</p>
<p>For example, the following class has converting constructors from two different arithmetic types, and conversion operators to two different arithmetic types:</p>
<p><a id="filepos3745401"></a></p>

```c++
struct A {
    A(int = 0);   // usually a bad idea to have two
    A(double);    // conversions from arithmetic types
    operator int() const;    // usually a bad idea to have two
    operator double() const; // conversions to arithmetic types
    //   other members

};
void f2(long double);
A a;
f2(a); // error ambiguous: f(A::operator int())
       //          or f(A::operator double())
long lg;
A a2(lg); // error ambiguous: A::A(int) or A::A(double)
```

<p>In the call to <code>f2</code>, neither conversion is an exact match to <code>long double</code>. However, either conversion can be used, followed by a standard conversion to get to <code>long double</code>. Hence, neither conversion is better than the other; the call is ambiguous.</p>
<p>We encounter the same problem when we try to initialize <code>a2</code> from a <code>long</code>. Neither constructor is an exact match for <code>long</code>. Each would require that the argument be converted before using the constructor:</p>
<ul><li>Standard <code>long</code> to <code>double</code> conversion followed by <code>A(double)</code></li><li>Standard <code>long</code> to <code>int</code> conversion followed by <code>A(int)</code></li></ul>

<p>These conversion sequences are indistinguishable, so the call is ambiguous.</p>
<p>The call to <code>f2</code>, and the initialization of <code>a2</code>, are ambiguous because the standard conversions that were needed had the same rank (§ <a href="068-6.6._function_matching.html#filepos1689576">6.6.1</a>, p. <a href="068-6.6._function_matching.html#filepos1689576">245</a>). When a user-defined conversion is used, the rank of the standard conversion, if any, is used to select the best match:</p>

```c++
short s = 42;
// promoting short to int is better than converting short to double
A a3(s);  // uses A::A(int)
```

<p>In this case, promoting a <code>short</code> to an <code>int</code> is preferred to converting the <code>short</code> to a <code>double</code>. Hence <code>a3</code> is constructed using the <code>A::A(int)</code> constructor, which is run on the (promoted) value of <code>s</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>When two user-defined conversions are used, the rank of the standard conversion, if any, <em>preceding</em> or <em>following</em> the conversion function is used to select the best match.</p>
:::

<h5>Overloaded Functions and Converting Constructors</h5>
<p>Choosing among multiple conversions is further complicated when we call an overloaded function. If two or more conversions provide a viable match, then the conversions are considered equally good.</p>
<p>As one example, ambiguity problems can arise when overloaded functions take parameters that differ by class types that define the same converting constructors:</p>

::: info
<a id="filepos3752485"></a><p>Caution: Conversions and Operators</p>
<p>Correctly designing the overloaded operators, conversion constructors, and conversion functions for a class requires some care. In particular, ambiguities are easy to generate if a class defines both conversion operators and overloaded operators. A few rules of thumb can be helpful:</p>
<p>• Don’t define mutually converting classes—if class <code>Foo</code> has a constructor that takes an object of class <code>Bar</code>, do not give <code>Bar</code> a conversion operator to type <code>Foo</code>.</p>
<p>• Avoid conversions to the built-in arithmetic types. In particular, if you do define a conversion to an arithmetic type, then</p>
<p>– Do not define overloaded versions of the operators that take arithmetic types. If users need to use these operators, the conversion operation will convert objects of your type, and then the built-in operators can be used.</p>
<p>– Do not define a conversion to more than one arithmetic type. Let the standard conversions provide conversions to the other arithmetic types.</p>
<p>The easiest rule of all: With the exception of an <code>explicit</code> conversion to <code>bool</code>, avoid defining conversion functions and limit non<code>explicit</code> constructors to those that are “obviously right.”</p>
:::

```c++
struct C {
    C(int);
    // other members
};
struct D {
    D(int);
    // other members
};
void manip(const C&);
void manip(const D&);
manip(10); // error ambiguous: manip(C(10)) or manip(D(10))
```

<p>Here both <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> have constructors that take an <code>int</code>. Either constructor can be used to match a version of <code>manip</code>. Hence, the call is ambiguous: It could mean convert the <code>int</code> to <code>C</code> and call the first version of <code>manip</code>, or it could mean convert the <code>int</code> to <code>D</code> and call the second version.</p>
<p>The caller can disambiguate by explicitly constructing the correct type:</p>

```c++
manip(C(10)); // ok: calls manip(const C&)
```

::: warning
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Needing to use a constructor or a cast to convert an argument in a call to an overloaded function frequently is a sign of bad design.</p>
:::

<h5>Overloaded Functions and User-Defined Conversion</h5>
<p>In a call to an overloaded function, if two (or more) user-defined conversions provide a viable match, the conversions are considered equally good. The rank of <a id="filepos3758158"></a>any standard conversions that might or might not be required is not considered. Whether a built-in conversion is also needed is considered only if the overload set can be matched <em>using the same conversion function.</em></p>
<p>For example, our call to <code>manip</code> would be ambiguous even if one of the classes defined a constructor that required a standard conversion for the argument:</p>

```c++
struct E {
    E(double);
    // other members
};
void manip2(const C&);
void manip2(const E&);
// error ambiguous: two different user-defined conversions could be used
manip2(10); // manip2(C(10) or manip2(E(double(10)))
```

<p>In this case, <code>C</code> has a conversion from <code>int</code> and <code>E</code> has a conversion from <code>double</code>. For the call <code>manip2(10)</code>, both <code>manip2</code> functions are viable:</p>
<ul><li><code>manip2(const C&amp;)</code> is viable because <code>C</code> has a converting constructor that takes an <code>int</code>. That constructor is an exact match for the argument.</li><li><code>manip2(const E&amp;)</code> is viable because <code>E</code> has a converting constructor that takes a <code>double</code> and we can use a standard conversion to convert the <code>int</code> argument in order to use that converting constructor.</li></ul>

<p>Because calls to the overloaded functions require <em>different</em> user-defined conversions from one another, this call is ambiguous. In particular, even though one of the calls requires a standard conversion and the other is an exact match, the compiler will still flag this call as an error.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>In a call to an overloaded function, the rank of an additional standard conversion (if any) matters only if the viable functions require the same user-defined conversion. If different user-defined conversions are needed, then the call is ambiguous.</p>

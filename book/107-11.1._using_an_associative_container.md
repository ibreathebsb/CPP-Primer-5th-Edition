<h3 id="filepos2724280">11.1. Using an Associative Container</h3>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>Although most programmers are familiar with data structures such as <code>vector</code>s and <code>list</code>s, many have never used an associative data structure. Before we look at the details of how the library supports these types, it will be helpful to start with examples of how we can use these containers.</p>
<p>A <code>map</code> is a collection of key–value pairs. For example, each pair might contain a person’s name as a key and a phone number as its value. We speak of such a data structure as “mapping names to phone numbers.” The <code>map</code> type is often referred to as an <strong><a href="112-defined_terms.html#filepos2890650" id="filepos2725363">associative array</a></strong>. An associative array is like a “normal” array except that its subscripts don’t have to be integers. Values in a <code>map</code> are found by a key <a id="filepos2725651"></a>rather than by their position. Given a <code>map</code> of names to phone numbers, we’d use a person’s name as a subscript to fetch that person’s phone number.</p>
<p>In contrast, a <code>set</code> is simply a collection of keys. A <code>set</code> is most useful when we simply want to know whether a value is present. For example, a business might define a <code>set</code> named <code>bad_checks</code> to hold the names of individuals who have written bad checks. Before accepting a check, that business would query <code>bad_checks</code> to see whether the customer’s name was present.</p>
<h4>Using a <code>map</code></h4>
<p>A classic example that relies on associative arrays is a word-counting program:</p>

```c++
// count the number of times each word occurs in the input
map<string, size_t> word_count; // empty map from string to size_t
string word;
while (cin >> word)
        ++word_count[word];   // fetch and increment the counter for word
for (const auto &w : word_count) // for each element in the map
    // print the results
    cout <<  w.first << " occurs " << w.second
         << ((w.second > 1) ? " times" : " time") << endl;
```

<p>This program reads its input and reports how often each word appears.</p>
<p>Like the sequential containers, the associative containers are templates (§ <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos736471">3.3</a>, p. <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos736471">96</a>). To define a <code>map</code>, we must specify both the key and value types. In this program, the <code>map</code> stores elements in which the keys are <code>string</code>s and the values are <code>size_t</code>s (§ <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos873638">3.5.2</a>, p. <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos873638">116</a>). When we subscript <code>word_count</code>, we use a <code>string</code> as the subscript, and we get back the <code>size_t</code> counter associated with that <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop reads the standard input one word at a time. It uses each word to subscript <code>word_count</code>. If <code>word</code> is not already in the <code>map</code>, the subscript operator creates a new element whose key is <code>word</code> and whose value is <code>0</code>. Regardless of whether the element had to be created, we increment the value.</p>
<p>Once we’ve read all the input, the range <code>for</code> (§ <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">3.2.3</a>, p. <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">91</a>) iterates through the <code>map</code>, printing each word and the corresponding counter. When we fetch an element from a <code>map</code>, we get an object of type <code>pair</code>, which we’ll describe in § <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2764131">11.2.3</a> (p. <a href="108-11.2._overview_of_the_associative_containers.html#filepos2764131">426</a>). Briefly, a <code>pair</code> is a template type that holds two (<code>public</code>) data elements named <code>first</code> and <code>second</code>. The <code>pair</code>s used by <code>map</code> have a <code>first</code> member that is the key and a <code>second</code> member that is the corresponding value. Thus, the effect of the output statement is to print each word and its associated counter.</p>
<p>If we ran this program on the text of the first paragraph in this section, our output would be</p>

```
Although occurs 1 time
Before occurs 1 time
an occurs 1 time
and occurs 1 time
...
```

<h4><a id="filepos2732953"></a>Using a <code>set</code></h4>
<p>A logical extension to our program is to ignore common words like “the,” “and,” “or,” and so on. We’ll use a <code>set</code> to hold the words we want to ignore and count only those words that are not in this set:</p>

```c++
// count the number of times each word occurs in the input
map<string, size_t> word_count; // empty map from string to size_t
set<string> exclude = {"The", "But", "And", "Or", "An", "A",
                       "the", "but", "and", "or", "an", "a"};
string word;
while (cin >> word)
    // count only words that are not in exclude
    if (exclude.find(word) == exclude.end())
        ++word_count[word];   // fetch and increment the counter for word
```

<p>Like the other containers, <code>set</code> is a template. To define a <code>set</code>, we specify the type of its elements, which in this case are <code>string</code>s. As with the sequential containers, we can list initialize (§ <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2221429">9.2.4</a>, p. <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2221429">336</a>) the elements of an associative container. Our <code>exclude</code> set holds the 12 words we want to ignore.</p>
<p>The important difference between this program and the previous program is that before counting each word, we check whether the word is in the exclusion set. We do this check in the <code>if</code>:</p>

```c++
// count only words that are not in exclude
if (exclude.find(word) == exclude.end())
```

<p>The call to <code>find</code> returns an iterator. If the given key is in the <code>set</code>, the iterator refers to that key. If the element is not found, <code>find</code> returns the off-the-end iterator. In this version, we update the counter for <code>word</code> only if <code>word</code> is not in <code>exclude</code>.</p>
<p>If we run this version on the same input as before, our output would be</p>

```
Although occurs 1 time
Before occurs 1 time
are occurs 1 time

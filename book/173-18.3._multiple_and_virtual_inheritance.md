<h3 id="filepos5026780">18.3. Multiple and Virtual Inheritance</h3>
<p><strong><a href="175-defined_terms.html#filepos5110729" id="filepos5026929">Multiple inheritance</a></strong> is the ability to derive a class from more than one direct base class (§ <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">600</a>). A multiply derived class inherits the properties of all its parents. Although simple in concept, the details of intertwining multiple base classes can present tricky design-level and implementation-level problems.</p>
<p>To explore multiple inheritance, we’ll use a pedagogical example of a zoo animal hierarchy. Our zoo animals exist at different levels of abstraction. There are the individual animals, distinguished by their names, such as Ling-ling, Mowgli, and Balou. Each animal belongs to a species; Ling-Ling, for example, is a giant <a id="filepos5027759"></a>panda. Species, in turn, are members of families. A giant panda is a member of the bear family. Each family, in turn, is a member of the animal kingdom—in this case, the more limited kingdom of a particular zoo.</p>
<p>We’ll define an abstract <code>ZooAnimal</code> class to hold information that is common to all the zoo animals and provides the most general interface. The <code>Bear</code> class will contain information that is unique to the <code>Bear</code> family, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>ZooAnimal</code> classes, our application will contain auxiliary classes that encapsulate various abstractions such as endangered animals. In our implementation of a <code>Panda</code> class, for example, a <code>Panda</code> is multiply derived from <code>Bear</code> and <code>Endangered</code>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos5029133">18.3.1. Multiple Inheritance</h4>
<p>The derivation list in a derived class can contain more than one base class:</p>

```c++
class Bear : public ZooAnimal {
class Panda : public Bear, public Endangered { /* ... */ };
```

<p>Each base class has an optional access specifier (§ <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a>, p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">612</a>). As usual, if the access specifier is omitted, the specifier defaults to <code>private</code> if the <code>class</code> keyword is used and to <code>public</code> if <code>struct</code> is used (§ <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a>, p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">616</a>).</p>
<p>As with single inheritance, the derivation list may include only classes that have been defined and that were not defined as <code>final</code> (§ <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">600</a>). There is no language-imposed limit on the number of base classes from which a class can be derived. A base class may appear only once in a given derivation list.</p>
<h5>Multiply Derived Classes Inherit State from Each Base Class</h5>
<p>Under multiple inheritance, an object of a derived class contains a subobject for each of its base classes (§ <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">597</a>). For example, as illustrated in <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5031930">Figure 18.2</a>, a <code>Panda</code> object has a <code>Bear</code> part (which itself contains a <code>ZooAnimal</code> part), an <code>Endangered</code> class part, and the non<code>static</code> data members, if any, declared within the <code>Panda</code> class.</p>
<a id="filepos5031930"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00133.jpg"/>
<p>Figure 18.2. Conceptual Structure of a <code>Panda</code> Object</p>
<h5><a id="filepos5032290"></a>Derived Constructors Initialize All Base Classes</h5>
<p>Constructing an object of derived type constructs and initializes all its base subobjects. As is the case for inheriting from a single base class (§ <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">598</a>), a derived type’s constructor initializer may initialize only its direct base classes:</p>

```c++
// explicitly initialize both base classes
Panda::Panda(std::string name, bool onExhibit)
      : Bear(name, onExhibit, "Panda"),
        Endangered(Endangered::critical) { }
// implicitly uses the Bear default constructor to initialize the Bear subobject
Panda::Panda()
      : Endangered(Endangered::critical) { }
```

<p>The constructor initializer list may pass arguments to each of the direct base classes. The order in which base classes are constructed depends on the order in which they appear in the class derivation list. The order in which they appear in the constructor initializer list is irrelevant. A <code>Panda</code> object is initialized as follows:</p>
<ul><li><code>ZooAnimal</code>, the ultimate base class up the hierarchy from <code>Panda</code>’s first direct base class, <code>Bear</code>, is initialized first.</li><li><code>Bear</code>, the first direct base class, is initialized next.</li><li><code>Endangered</code>, the second direct base, is initialized next.</li><li><code>Panda</code>, the most derived part, is initialized last.</li></ul>

<h5>Inherited Constructors and Multiple Inheritance</h5>
<a id="filepos5035521"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>Under the new standard, a derived class can inherit its constructors from one or more of its base classes (§ <a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos4009689">15.7.4</a>, p. <a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos4009689">628</a>). It is an error to inherit the same constructor (i.e., one with the same parameter list) from more than one base class:</p>

```c++
struct Base1 {
    Base1() = default;
    Base1(const std::string&);
    Base1(std::shared_ptr<int>);
};

struct Base2 {
    Base2() = default;
    Base2(const std::string&);
    Base2(int);
};

// error: D1 attempts to inherit D1::D1 (const string&) from both base classes
struct D1: public Base1, public Base2 {
    using Base1::Base1;  // inherit constructors from Base1
    using Base2::Base2;  // inherit constructors from Base2
};
```

<p>A class that inherits the same constructor from more than one base class must define its own version of that constructor:</p>
<p><a id="filepos5037740"></a></p>

```c++
struct D2: public Base1, public Base2 {
    using Base1::Base1;  //  inherit constructors from Base1
    using Base2::Base2;  //  inherit constructors from Base2
    // D2 must define its own constructor that takes a string
    D2(const string &s): Base1(s), Base2(s) { }
    D2() = default; // needed once D2 defines its own constructor
};
```

<h5>Destructors and Multiple Inheritance</h5>
<p>As usual, the destructor in a derived class is responsible for cleaning up resources allocated by that class only—the members and all the base class(es) of the derived class are automatically destroyed. The synthesized destructor has an empty function body.</p>
<p>Destructors are always invoked in the reverse order from which the constructors are run. In our example, the order in which the destructors are called is <code>~Panda</code>, <code>~Endangered</code>, <code>~Bear</code>, <code>~ZooAnimal</code>.</p>
<h5>Copy and Move Operations for Multiply Derived Classes</h5>
<p>As is the case for single inheritance, classes with multiple bases that define their own copy/move constructors and assignment operators must copy, move, or assign the whole object (§ <a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos3980968">15.7.2</a>, p. <a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos3980968">623</a>). The base parts of a multiply derived class are automatically copied, moved, or assigned only if the derived class uses the synthesized versions of these members. In the synthesized copy-control members, each base class is implicitly constructed, assigned, or destroyed, using the corresponding member from that base class.</p>
<p>For example, assuming that <code>Panda</code> uses the synthesized members, then the initialization of <code>ling_ling</code>:</p>

```c++
Panda ying_yang("ying_yang");
Panda ling_ling = ying_yang;    // uses the copy constructor
```

<p>will invoke the <code>Bear</code> copy constructor, which in turn runs the <code>ZooAnimal</code> copy constructor before executing the <code>Bear</code> copy constructor. Once the <code>Bear</code> portion of <code>ling_ling</code> is constructed, the <code>Endangered</code> copy constructor is run to create that part of the object. Finally, the <code>Panda</code> copy constructor is run. Similarly, for the synthesized move constructor.</p>
<p>The synthesized copy-assignment operator behaves similarly to the copy constructor. It assigns the <code>Bear</code> (and through <code>Bear</code>, the <code>ZooAnimal</code>) parts of the object first. Next, it assigns the <code>Endangered</code> part, and finally the <code>Panda</code> part. Move assignment behaves similarly.</p>
<h4 id="filepos5043117">18.3.2. Conversions and Multiple Base Classes</h4>
<p>Under single inheritance, a pointer or a reference to a derived class can be converted automatically to a pointer or a reference to an accessible base class (§ <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">597</a>, and § <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a>, p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">613</a>). The same holds true with multiple inheritance. A pointer or reference to any of an object’s (accessible) base classes can be used to point or <a id="filepos5043731"></a>refer to a derived object. For example, a pointer or reference to <code>ZooAnimal</code>, <code>Bear</code>, or <code>Endangered</code> can be bound to a <code>Panda</code> object:</p>

```c++
// operations that take references to base classes of type Panda
void print(const Bear&);
void highlight(const Endangered&);
ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const ZooAnimal&);

Panda ying_yang("ying_yang");

print(ying_yang);     // passes Panda to a reference to Bear
highlight(ying_yang); // passes Panda to a reference to Endangered
cout << ying_yang << endl; // passes Panda to a reference to ZooAnimal
```

<p>what is the order of constructor execution for the following definition?</p>

:::

<p>The compiler makes no attempt to distinguish between base classes in terms of a derived-class conversion. Converting to each base class is equally good. For example, if there was an overloaded version of <code>print</code>:</p>

```c++
void print(const Bear&);
void print(const Endangered&);
```

<p>an unqualified call to <code>print</code> with a <code>Panda</code> object would be a compile-time error:</p>

```c++
Panda ying_yang("ying_yang");
print(ying_yang);             // error: ambiguous
```

<h5>Lookup Based on Type of Pointer or Reference</h5>
<p>As with single inheritance, the static type of the object, pointer, or reference determines which members we can use (§ <a href="147-15.6._class_scope_under_inheritance.html#filepos3941072">15.6</a>, p. <a href="147-15.6._class_scope_under_inheritance.html#filepos3941072">617</a>). If we use a <code>ZooAnimal</code> pointer, <a id="filepos5049855"></a>only the operations defined in that class are usable. The <code>Bear</code>-specific, <code>Panda-</code>specific, and <code>Endangered</code> portions of the <code>Panda</code> interface are invisible. Similarly, a <code>Bear</code> pointer or reference knows only about the <code>Bear</code> and <code>ZooAnimal</code> members; an <code>Endangered</code> pointer or reference is limited to the <code>Endangered</code> members.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following calls, which assume that our classes define the virtual functions listed in <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5054351">Table 18.1</a>:</p>

```c++
Bear *pb = new Panda("ying_yang");

pb->print();      // ok: Panda::print()
pb->cuddle();     // error: not part of the Bear interface
pb->highlight();  // error: not part of the Bear interface
delete pb;        // ok: Panda::~Panda()
```

<p>When a <code>Panda</code> is used via an <code>Endangered</code> pointer or reference, the <code>Panda-</code>specific and <code>Bear</code> portions of the <code>Panda</code> interface are invisible:</p>

```c++
Endangered *pe = new Panda("ying_yang");
pe->print();     // ok: Panda::print()
pe->toes();      // error: not part of the Endangered interface
pe->cuddle();    // error: not part of the Endangered interface
pe->highlight(); // ok: Panda::highlight()
delete pe;       // ok: Panda::~Panda()
```

<img alt="Image" src="/images/00134.jpg"/>
<h4 id="filepos5054669">18.3.3. Class Scope under Multiple Inheritance</h4>
<p>Under single inheritance, the scope of a derived class is nested within the scope of its direct and indirect base classes (§ <a href="147-15.6._class_scope_under_inheritance.html#filepos3941072">15.6</a>, p. <a href="147-15.6._class_scope_under_inheritance.html#filepos3941072">617</a>). Lookup happens by searching up the inheritance hierarchy until the given name is found. Names defined in a derived class hide uses of that name inside a base.</p>
<p>Under multiple inheritance, this same lookup happens <em>simultaneously</em> among all the direct base classes. If a name is found through more than one base class, then use of that name is ambiguous.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 18.24:</strong> On page <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5049855">807</a> we presented a series of calls made through a <code>Bear</code> pointer that pointed to a <code>Panda</code> object. Explain each call assuming we used a <code>ZooAnimal</code> pointer pointing to a <code>Panda</code> object instead.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 18.25:</strong> Assume we have two base classes, <code>Base1</code> and <code>Base2</code>, each of which defines a virtual member named <code>print</code> and a virtual destructor. From these base classes we derive the following classes, each of which redefines the <code>print</code> function:</p>

```c++
class D1 : public Base1 { /* ... */ };
class D2 : public Base2 { /* ... */ };
class MI : public D1, public D2 { /* ... */ };
```

<p>Using the following pointers, determine which function is used in each call:</p>

```c++
Base1 *pb1 = new MI;
Base2 *pb2 = new MI;
D1 *pd1 = new MI;
D2 *pd2 = new MI;
```

<p><strong>(a)</strong>
<code>pb1-&gt;print();</code></p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong>
<code>pd1-&gt;print();</code></p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong>
<code>pd2-&gt;print();</code></p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong>
<code>delete pb2;</code></p>
<p><strong>(e)</strong>
<code>delete pd1;</code></p>
<p><strong>(f)</strong>
<code>delete pd2;</code></p>
:::

<p>In our example, if we use a name through a <code>Panda</code> object, pointer, or reference, both the <code>Endangered</code> and the <code>Bear/ZooAnimal</code> subtrees are examined in parallel. If the name is found in more than one subtree, then the use of the name is ambiguous. It is perfectly legal for a class to inherit multiple members with the same name. However, if we want to use that name, we must specify which version we want to use.</p>

::: warning
<p>When a class has multiple base classes, it is possible for that derived class to inherit a member with the same name from two or more of its base classes. Unqualified uses of that name are ambiguous.</p>
:::

<p>For example, if both <code>ZooAnimal</code> and <code>Endangered</code> define a member named <code>max_weight</code>, and <code>Panda</code> does not define that member, this call is an error:</p>

```c++
double d = ying_yang.max_weight();
```

<p>The derivation of <code>Panda</code>, which results in <code>Panda</code> having two members named <code>max_weight</code>, is perfectly legal. The derivation generates a <em>potential</em> ambiguity. That ambiguity is avoided if no <code>Panda</code> object ever calls <code>max_weight</code>. The error <a id="filepos5062722"></a>would also be avoided if each call to <code>max_weight</code> specifically indicated which version to run—<code>ZooAnimal::max_weight</code> or <code>Endangered::max_weight</code>. An error results only if there is an ambiguous attempt to use the member.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of the two inherited <code>max_weight</code> members is reasonably obvious. It might be more surprising to learn that an error would be generated even if the two inherited functions had different parameter lists. Similarly, it would be an error even if the <code>max_weight</code> function were <code>private</code> in one class and <code>public</code> or <code>protected</code> in the other. Finally, if <code>max_weight</code> were defined in <code>Bear</code> and not in <code>ZooAnimal</code>, the call would still be in error.</p>
<p>As always, name lookup happens before type checking (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1621309">6.4.1</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1621309">234</a>). When the compiler finds <code>max_weight</code> in two different scopes, it generates an error noting that the call is ambiguous.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid potential ambiguities is to define a version of the function in the derived class that resolves the ambiguity. For example, we should give our <code>Panda</code> class a <code>max_weight</code> function that resolves the ambiguity:</p>

```c++
double Panda::max_weight() const
{
    return std::max(ZooAnimal::max_weight(),
                    Endangered::max_weight());
}

<h4 id="filepos5071122">18.3.4. Virtual Inheritance</h4>
<p>Although the derivation list of a class may not include the same base class more than once, a class can inherit from the same base class more than once. It might inherit the same base indirectly from two of its own direct base classes, or it might inherit a particular class directly and indirectly through another of its base classes.</p>
<p>As an example, the IO library <code>istream</code> and <code>ostream</code> classes each inherit from a common abstract base class named <code>basic_ios</code>. That class holds the stream’s buffer and manages the stream’s condition state. The class <code>iostream</code>, which can both read and write to a stream, inherits directly from both <code>istream</code> and <code>ostream</code>. Because both types inherit from <code>basic_ios</code>, <code>iostream</code> inherits that base class twice, once through <code>istream</code> and once through <code>ostream</code>.</p>
<p>By default, a derived object contains a separate subpart corresponding to each class in its derivation chain. If the same base class appears more than once in the derivation, then the derived object will have more than one subobject of that type.</p>
<p>This default doesn’t work for a class such as <code>iostream</code>. An <code>iostream</code> object <a id="filepos5073319"></a>wants to use the same buffer for both reading and writing, and it wants its condition state to reflect both input and output operations. If an <code>iostream</code> object has two copies of its <code>basic_ios</code> class, this sharing isn’t possible.</p>
<p>In C++ we solve this kind of problem by using <strong><a href="175-defined_terms.html#filepos5120968" id="filepos5073804">virtual inheritance</a></strong>. Virtual inheritance lets a class specify that it is willing to share its base class. The shared base-class subobject is called a <strong><a href="175-defined_terms.html#filepos5120267" id="filepos5074015">virtual base class</a></strong>. Regardless of how often the same virtual base appears in an inheritance hierarchy, the derived object contains only one, shared subobject for that virtual base class.</p>
<h5>A Different <code>Panda</code> Class</h5>
<p>In the past, there was some debate as to whether panda belongs to the raccoon or the bear family. To reflect this debate, we can change <code>Panda</code> to inherit from both <code>Bear</code> and <code>Raccoon</code>. To avoid giving <code>Panda</code> two <code>ZooAnimal</code> base parts, we’ll define <code>Bear</code> and <code>Raccoon</code> to inherit virtually from <code>ZooAnimal</code>. <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5075458">Figure 18.3</a> illustrates our new hierarchy.</p>
<a id="filepos5075458"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00135.jpg"/>
<p>Figure 18.3. Virtual Inheritance <code>Panda</code> Hierarchy</p>
<p>Looking at our new hierarchy, we’ll notice a nonintuitive aspect of virtual inheritance. The virtual derivation has to be made before the need for it appears. For example, in our classes, the need for virtual inheritance arises only when we define <code>Panda</code>. However, if <code>Bear</code> and <code>Raccoon</code> had not specified <code>virtual</code> on their derivation from <code>ZooAnimal</code>, the designer of the <code>Panda</code> class would be out of luck.</p>
<p>In practice, the requirement that an intermediate base class specify its inheritance as virtual rarely causes any problems. Ordinarily, a class hierarchy that uses virtual inheritance is designed at one time either by one individual or by a single project design group. It is exceedingly rare for a class to be developed independently that needs a virtual base in one of its base classes and in which the developer of the new base class cannot change the existing hierarchy.</p>

::: info
<p>Virtual derivation affects the classes that subsequently derive from a class with a virtual base; it doesn’t affect the derived class itself.</p>
:::

<h5><a id="filepos5077680"></a>Using a Virtual Base Class</h5>
<p>We specify that a base class is virtual by including the keyword <code>virtual</code> in the derivation list:</p>

```c++
// the order of the keywords public and virtual is not significant
class Raccoon : public virtual ZooAnimal { /* ... */ };
class Bear : virtual public ZooAnimal { /* ... */ };
```

<p>Here we’ve made <code>ZooAnimal</code> a virtual base class of both <code>Bear</code> and <code>Raccoon</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>virtual</code> specifier states a willingness to share a single instance of the named base class within a subsequently derived class. There are no special constraints on a class used as a virtual base class.</p>
<p>We do nothing special to inherit from a class that has a virtual base:</p>

```c++
class Panda : public Bear,
              public Raccoon, public Endangered {
};
```

<p>Here <code>Panda</code> inherits <code>ZooAnimal</code> through both its <code>Raccoon</code> and <code>Bear</code> base classes. However, because those classes inherited virtually from <code>ZooAnimal, Panda</code> has only one <code>ZooAnimal</code> base subpart.</p>
<h5>Normal Conversions to Base Are Supported</h5>
<p>An object of a derived class can be manipulated (as usual) through a pointer or a reference to an accessible base-class type regardless of whether the base class is virtual. For example, all of the following <code>Panda</code> base-class conversions are legal:</p>

```c++
void dance(const Bear&);
void rummage(const Raccoon&);
ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const ZooAnimal&);
Panda ying_yang;
dance(ying_yang);   // ok: passes Panda object as a Bear
rummage(ying_yang); // ok: passes Panda object as a Raccoon
cout << ying_yang;  // ok: passes Panda object as a ZooAnimal
```

<h5>Visibility of Virtual Base-Class Members</h5>
<p>Because there is only one shared subobject corresponding to each shared virtual base, members in that base can be accessed directly and unambiguously. Moreover, if a member from the virtual base is overridden along only one derivation path, then that overridden member can still be accessed directly. If the member is overridden by more than one base, then the derived class generally must define its own version as well.</p>
<p>For example, assume class <code>B</code> defines a member named <code>x</code>; class <code>D1</code> inherits virtually from <code>B</code> as does class <code>D2;</code> and class <code>D</code> inherits from <code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>. From the scope of <code>D</code>, <code>x</code> is visible through both of its base classes. If we use <code>x</code> through a <code>D</code> object, there are three possibilities:</p>
<ul><li>If <code>x</code> is not defined in either <code>D1</code> or <code>D2</code> it will be resolved as a member in <code>B</code>; there is no ambiguity. A <code>D</code> object contains only one instance of <code>x</code>.</li><li><a id="filepos5084926"></a>If <code>x</code> is a member of <code>B</code> and also a member in one, but not both, of <code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>, there is again no ambiguity—the version in the derived class is given precedence over the shared virtual base class, <code>B</code>.</li><li>If <code>x</code> is defined in both <code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>, then direct access to that member is ambiguous.</li></ul>

<p>As in a nonvirtual multiple inheritance hierarchy, ambiguities of this sort are best resolved by the derived class providing its own instance of that member.</p>

<h4 id="filepos5088013">18.3.5. Constructors and Virtual Inheritance</h4>
<p>In a virtual derivation, the virtual base is initialized by the <em>most derived constructor</em>. In our example, when we create a <code>Panda</code> object, the <code>Panda</code> constructor alone controls how the <code>ZooAnimal</code> base class is initialized.</p>
<p>To understand this rule, consider what would happen if normal initialization rules applied. In that case, a virtual base class might be initialized more than once. It would be initialized along each inheritance path that contains that virtual base. In our <code>ZooAnimal</code> example, if normal initialization rules applied, both <code>Bear</code> and <code>Raccoon</code> would initialize the <code>ZooAnimal</code> part of a <code>Panda</code> object.</p>
<p>Of course, each class in the hierarchy might at some point be the “most derived” object. As long as we can create independent objects of a type derived from <a id="filepos5089580"></a>a virtual base, the constructors in that class must initialize its virtual base. For example, in our hierarchy, when a <code>Bear</code> (or a <code>Raccoon</code>) object is created, there is no further derived type involved. In this case, the <code>Bear</code> (or <code>Raccoon</code>) constructors directly initialize their <code>ZooAnimal</code> base as usual:</p>

```c++
Bear::Bear(std::string name, bool onExhibit):
         ZooAnimal(name, onExhibit, "Bear") { }
Raccoon::Raccoon(std::string name, bool onExhibit)
       : ZooAnimal(name, onExhibit, "Raccoon") { }
```

<p>When a <code>Panda</code> is created, it is the most derived type and controls initialization of the shared <code>ZooAnimal</code> base. Even though <code>ZooAnimal</code> is not a direct base of <code>Panda</code>, the <code>Panda</code> constructor initializes <code>ZooAnimal</code>:</p>

```c++
Panda::Panda(std::string name, bool onExhibit)
      : ZooAnimal(name, onExhibit, "Panda"),
        Bear(name, onExhibit),
        Raccoon(name, onExhibit),
        Endangered(Endangered::critical),
        sleeping_flag(false)   { }
```

<h5>How a Virtually Inherited Object Is Constructed</h5>
<p>The construction order for an object with a virtual base is slightly modified from the normal order: The virtual base subparts of the object are initialized first, using initializers provided in the constructor for the most derived class. Once the virtual base subparts of the object are constructed, the direct base subparts are constructed in the order in which they appear in the derivation list.</p>
<p>For example, when a <code>Panda</code> object is created:</p>
<ul><li>The (virtual base class) <code>ZooAnimal</code> part is constructed first, using the initializers specified in the <code>Panda</code> constructor initializer list.</li><li>The <code>Bear</code> part is constructed next.</li><li>The <code>Raccoon</code> part is constructed next.</li><li>The third direct base, <code>Endangered</code>, is constructed next.</li><li>Finally, the <code>Panda</code> part is constructed.</li></ul>

<p>If the <code>Panda</code> constructor does not explicitly initialize the <code>ZooAnimal</code> base class, then the <code>ZooAnimal</code> default constructor is used. If <code>ZooAnimal</code> doesn’t have a default constructor, then the code is in error.</p>

::: info
<p>Virtual base classes are always constructed prior to nonvirtual base classes regardless of where they appear in the inheritance hierarchy.</p>
:::

<h5>Constructor and Destructor Order</h5>
<p>A class can have more than one virtual base class. In that case, the virtual subobjects are constructed in left-to-right order as they appear in the derivation list. For <a id="filepos5095425"></a>example, in the following whimsical <code>TeddyBear</code> derivation, there are two virtual base classes: <code>ToyAnimal</code>, a direct virtual base, and <code>ZooAnimal</code>, which is a virtual base class of <code>Bear</code>:</p>

```c++
class Character { /* ... */ };
class BookCharacter : public Character { /* ... */ };

class ToyAnimal { /* ... */ };

class TeddyBear : public BookCharacter,
                  public Bear, public virtual ToyAnimal
                  { /* ... */ };
```

<p>The direct base classes are examined in declaration order to determine whether there are any virtual base classes. If so, the virtual bases are constructed first, followed by the nonvirtual base-class constructors in declaration order. Thus, to create a <code>TeddyBear</code>, the constructors are invoked in the following order:</p>

```c++
ZooAnimal();        // Bear's virtual base class
ToyAnimal();        // direct virtual base class
Character();        // indirect base class of first nonvirtual base class
BookCharacter();    // first direct nonvirtual base class
Bear();             // second direct nonvirtual base class
TeddyBear();        // most derived class
```

<p>The same order is used in the synthesized copy and move constructors, and members are assigned in this order in the synthesized assignment operators. As usual, an object is destroyed in reverse order from which it was constructed. The <code>TeddyBear</code> part will be destroyed first and the <code>ZooAnimal</code> part last.</p>

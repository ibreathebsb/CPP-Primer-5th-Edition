<h3>Aids to the Reader</h3>
<p>Each chapter concludes with a summary, followed by a glossary of defined terms, which together recap the chapter’s most important points. Readers should use these sections as a personal checklist: If you do not understand a term, restudy the corresponding part of the chapter.</p>
<p>We’ve also incorporated a number of other learning aids in the body of the text:</p>
<ul><li>Important terms are indicated in <strong>bold</strong>; important terms that we assume are already familiar to the reader are indicated in <em><strong>bold italics</strong></em>. Each term appears in the chapter’s Defined Terms section.</li><li>Throughout the book, we highlight parts of the text to call attention to important aspects of the language, warn about common pitfalls, suggest good programming practices, and provide general usage tips.</li><li>To make it easier to follow the relationships among features and concepts, we provide extensive forward and backward cross-references.</li><li>We provide sidebar discussions on important concepts and for topics that new C++ programmers often find most difficult.</li><li>Learning any programming language requires writing programs. To that end, the Primer provides extensive examples throughout the text. Source code for the extended examples is available on the Web at the following URL:</li></ul>

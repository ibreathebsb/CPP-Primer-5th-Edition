<p>This chapter introduced enough of C++ to let you compile and execute simple C++ programs. We saw how to define a <code>main</code> function, which is the function that the operating system calls to execute our program. We also saw how to define variables, how to do input and output, and how to write <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code> statements. The chapter closed by introducing the most fundamental facility in C++: the class. In this chapter, we saw how to create and use objects of a class that someone else has defined. Later chapters will show how to define our own classes.</p>

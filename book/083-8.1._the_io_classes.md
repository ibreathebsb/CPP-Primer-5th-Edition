<h3 id="filepos2076693">8.1. The IO Classes</h3>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>The IO types and objects that we’ve used so far manipulate <code>char</code> data. By default these objects are connected to the user’s console window. Of course, real programs cannot be limited to doing IO solely to or from a console window. Programs often need to read or write named files. Moreover, it can be convenient to use IO operations to process the characters in a <code>string</code>. Applications also may have to read and write languages that require wide-character support.</p>
<p>To support these different kinds of IO processing, the library defines a collection of IO types in addition to the <code>istream</code> and <code>ostream</code> types that we have already used. These types, which are listed in <a href="083-8.1._the_io_classes.html#filepos2078474">Table 8.1</a>, are defined in three separate headers: <code>iostream</code> defines the basic types used to read from and write to a stream, <code>fstream</code> defines the types used to read and write named files, and <code>sstream</code> defines the types used to read and write in-memory <code>string</code>s.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2078474"></a>Table 8.1. IO Library Types and Headers</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00041.jpg"/>
<p><a id="filepos2078675"></a>To support languages that use wide characters, the library defines a set of types and objects that manipulate <code>wchar_t</code> data (§ <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos288881">2.1.1</a>, p. <a href="021-2.1._primitive_builtin_types.html#filepos288881">32</a>). The names of the wide-character versions begin with a <code>w</code>. For example, <code>wcin, wcout</code>, and <code>wcerr</code> are the wide-character objects that correspond to <code>cin, cout</code>, and <code>cerr</code>, respectively. The wide-character types and objects are defined in the same header as the plain <code>char</code> types. For example, the <code>fstream</code> header defines both the <code>ifstream</code> and <code>wifstream</code> types.</p>
<h4>Relationships among the IO Types</h4>
<p>Conceptually, neither the kind of device nor the character size affects the IO operations we want to perform. For example, we’d like to use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to read data regardless of whether we’re reading a console window, a disk file, or a <code>string</code>. Similarly, we’d like to use that operator regardless of whether the characters we read fit in a <code>char</code> or require a <code>wchar_t</code>.</p>
<p>The library lets us ignore the differences among these different kinds of streams by using <strong><a href="087-defined_terms.html#filepos2168159" id="filepos2080823">inheritance</a></strong>. As with templates (§ <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos736471">3.3</a>, p. <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos736471">96</a>), we can use classes related by inheritance without understanding the details of how inheritance works. We’ll cover how C++ supports inheritance in <a href="141-chapter_15._objectoriented_programming.html#filepos3778984">Chapter 15</a> and in § <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5026780">18.3</a> (p. <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5026780">802</a>).</p>
<p>Briefly, inheritance lets us say that a particular class inherits from another class. Ordinarily, we can use an object of an inherited class as if it were an object of the same type as the class from which it inherits.</p>
<p>The types <code>ifstream</code> and <code>istringstream</code> inherit from <code>istream</code>. Thus, we can use objects of type <code>ifstream</code> or <code>istringstream</code> as if they were <code>istream</code> objects. We can use objects of these types in the same ways as we have used <code>cin</code>. For example, we can call <code>getline</code> on an <code>ifstream</code> or <code>istringstream</code> object, and we can use the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to read data from an <code>ifstream</code> or <code>istringstream</code>. Similarly, the types <code>ofstream</code> and <code>ostringstream</code> inherit from <code>ostream</code>. Therefore, we can use objects of these types in the same ways that we have used <code>cout</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>Everything that we cover in the remainder of this section applies equally to plain streams, file streams, and <code>string</code> streams and to the <code>char</code> or wide-character stream versions.</p>

<h4 id="filepos2083864">8.1.1. No Copy or Assign for IO Objects</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>As we saw in § <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1792181">7.1.3</a> (p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1792181">261</a>), we cannot copy or assign objects of the IO types:</p>

```c++
ofstream out1, out2;
out1 = out2;              // error: cannot assign stream objects
ofstream print(ofstream); // error: can't initialize the ofstream parameter
out2 = print(out2);       // error: cannot copy stream objects
```

<p>Because we can’t copy the IO types, we cannot have a parameter or return type that is one of the stream types (§ <a href="064-6.2._argument_passing.html#filepos1453096">6.2.1</a>, p. <a href="064-6.2._argument_passing.html#filepos1453096">209</a>). Functions that do IO typically pass and return the stream through references. Reading or writing an IO object changes its state, so the reference must not be <code>const</code>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos2085669"><a id="filepos2085702"></a>8.1.2. Condition States</h4>
<p>Inherent in doing IO is the fact that errors can occur. Some errors are recoverable; others occur deep within the system and are beyond the scope of a program to correct. The IO classes define functions and flags, listed in <a href="083-8.1._the_io_classes.html#filepos2086262">Table 8.2</a>, that let us access and manipulate the <strong><a href="087-defined_terms.html#filepos2165704" id="filepos2086111">condition state</a></strong> of a stream.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2086262"></a>Table 8.2. IO Library Condition State</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00042.jpg"/>
<p>As an example of an IO error, consider the following code:</p>

```c++
int ival;
cin >> ival;
```

<p>If we enter <code>Boo</code> on the standard input, the read will fail. The input operator expected to read an <code>int</code> but got the character <code>B</code> instead. As a result, <code>cin</code> will be put in an error state. Similarly, <code>cin</code> will be in an error state if we enter an end-of-file.</p>
<p>Once an error has occurred, subsequent IO operations on that stream will fail. We can read from or write to a stream only when it is in a non-error state. Because a stream might be in an error state, code ordinarily should check whether a stream is okay before attempting to use it. The easiest way to determine the state of a stream object is to use that object as a condition:</p>

```c++
while (cin >> word)
    // ok: read operation successful . . .
```

<p>The <code>while</code> condition checks the state of the stream returned from the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> expression. If that input operation succeeds, the state remains valid and the condition will succeed.</p>
<h5>Interrogating the State of a Stream</h5>
<p>Using a stream as a condition tells us only whether the stream is valid. It does not tell us what happened. Sometimes we also need to know why the stream is invalid. For example, what we do after hitting end-of-file is likely to differ from what we’d do if we encounter an error on the IO device.</p>
<p>The IO library defines a machine-dependent integral type named <code>iostate</code> that it uses to convey information about the state of a stream. This type is used as a collection of bits, in the same way that we used the <code>quiz1</code> variable in § <a href="046-4.8._the_bitwise_operators.html#filepos1120642">4.8</a> (p. <a href="046-4.8._the_bitwise_operators.html#filepos1120642">154</a>). The IO classes define four <code>constexpr</code> values (§ <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos520427">2.4.4</a>, p. <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos520427">65</a>) of type <code>iostate</code> that represent particular bit patterns. These values are used to indicate particular kinds of IO conditions. They can be used with the bitwise operators (§ <a href="046-4.8._the_bitwise_operators.html#filepos1120642">4.8</a>, p. <a href="046-4.8._the_bitwise_operators.html#filepos1120642">152</a>) to test or set multiple flags in one operation.</p>
<p>The <code>badbit</code> indicates a system-level failure, such as an unrecoverable read or write error. It is usually not possible to use a stream once <code>badbit</code> has been set. The <code>failbit</code> is set after a recoverable error, such as reading a character when numeric data was expected. It is often possible to correct such problems and continue using the stream. Reaching end-of-file sets both <code>eofbit</code> and <code>failbit</code>. The <code>goodbit</code>, which is guaranteed to have the value 0, indicates no failures on the stream. If any of <code>badbit</code>, <code>failbit</code>, or <code>eofbit</code> are set, then a condition that evaluates that stream will fail.</p>
<p>The library also defines a set of functions to interrogate the state of these flags. The <code>good</code> operation returns <code>true</code> if none of the error bits is set. The <code>bad</code>, <code>fail</code>, <a id="filepos2091624"></a>and <code>eof</code> operations return <code>true</code> when the corresponding bit is on. In addition, <code>fail</code> returns <code>true</code> if <code>bad</code> is set. By implication, the right way to determine the overall state of a stream is to use either <code>good</code> or <code>fail</code>. Indeed, the code that is executed when we use a stream as a condition is equivalent to calling <code>!fail()</code>. The <code>eof</code> and <code>bad</code> operations reveal only whether those specific errors have occurred.</p>
<h5>Managing the Condition State</h5>
<p>The <code>rdstate</code> member returns an <code>iostate</code> value that corresponds to the current state of the stream. The <code>setstate</code> operation turns on the given condition bit(s) to indicate that a problem occurred. The <code>clear</code> member is overloaded (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">6.4</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">230</a>): One version takes no arguments and a second version takes a single argument of type <code>iostate</code>.</p>
<p>The version of <code>clear</code> that takes no arguments turns off all the failure bits. After <code>clear()</code>, a call to <code>good</code> returns <code>true</code>. We might use these members as follows:</p>

```c++
// remember the current state of cin
auto old_state = cin.rdstate();   // remember the current state of cin
cin.clear();                      // make cin valid
process_input(cin);               // use cin
cin.setstate(old_state);          // now reset cin to its old state
```

<p>The version of <code>clear</code> that takes an argument expects an <code>iostate</code> value that represents the new state of the stream. To turn off a single condition, we use the <code>rdstate</code> member and the bitwise operators to produce the desired new state.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2096162"></a>For example, the following turns off <code>failbit</code> and <code>badbit</code> but leaves <code>eofbit</code> untouched:</p>

```c++
// turns off failbit and badbit but all other bits unchanged
cin.clear(cin.rdstate() & ~cin.failbit & ~cin.badbit);
```

<h4 id="filepos2098548">8.1.3. Managing the Output Buffer</h4>
<p>Each output stream manages a buffer, which it uses to hold the data that the program reads and writes. For example, when the following code is executed</p>

```c++
os << "please enter a value: ";
```

<p>the literal string might be printed immediately, or the operating system might store the data in a buffer to be printed later. Using a buffer allows the operating system to combine several output operations from our program into a single system-level write. Because writing to a device can be time-consuming, letting the operating system combine several output operations into a single write can provide an important performance boost.</p>
<p>There are several conditions that cause the buffer to be flushed—that is, to be written—to the actual output device or file:</p>
<ul><li>The program completes normally. All output buffers are flushed as part of the <code>return</code> from <code>main</code>.</li><li>At some indeterminate time, the buffer can become full, in which case it will be flushed before writing the next value.</li><li>We can flush the buffer explicitly using a manipulator such as <code>endl</code> (§ <a href="012-1.2._a_first_look_at_inputoutput.html#filepos136281">1.2</a>, p. <a href="012-1.2._a_first_look_at_inputoutput.html#filepos136281">7</a>).</li><li>We can use the <code>unitbuf</code> manipulator to set the stream’s internal state to empty the buffer after each output operation. By default, <code>unitbuf</code> is set for <code>cerr</code>, so that writes to <code>cerr</code> are flushed immediately.</li><li>An output stream might be tied to another stream. In this case, the buffer of the tied stream is flushed whenever the tied stream is read or written. By default, <code>cin</code> and <code>cerr</code> are both tied to <code>cout</code>. Hence, reading <code>cin</code> or writing to <code>cerr</code> flushes the buffer in <code>cout</code>.</li></ul>

<h5><a id="filepos2101910"></a>Flushing the Output Buffer</h5>
<p>Our programs have already used the <code>endl</code> manipulator, which ends the current line and flushes the buffer. There are two other similar manipulators: <code>flush</code> and <code>ends. flush</code> flushes the stream but adds no characters to the output; <code>ends</code> inserts a null character into the buffer and then flushes it:</p>

```c++
cout << "hi!" << endl;   // writes hi and a newline, then flushes the buffer
cout << "hi!" << flush;  // writes hi, then flushes the buffer; adds no data
cout << "hi!" << ends;   // writes hi and a null, then flushes the buffer
```

<h5>The <code>unitbuf</code> Manipulator</h5>
<p>If we want to flush after every output, we can use the <code>unitbuf</code> manipulator. This manipulator tells the stream to do a <code>flush</code> after every subsequent write. The <code>nounitbuf</code> manipulator restores the stream to use normal, system-managed buffer flushing:</p>

```c++
cout << unitbuf;       // all writes will be flushed immediately
// any output is flushed immediately, no buffering
cout << nounitbuf;     // returns to normal buffering
```

::: info
<p>Caution: Buffers Are Not Flushed If the Program Crashes</p>
<p>Output buffers are <em>not</em> flushed if the program terminates abnormally. When a program crashes, it is likely that data the program wrote may be sitting in an output buffer waiting to be printed.</p>
<p>When you debug a program that has crashed, it is essential to make sure that any output you <em>think</em> should have been written was actually flushed. Countless hours of programmer time have been wasted tracking through code that appeared not to have executed when in fact the buffer had not been flushed and the output was pending when the program crashed.</p>
:::

<h5>Tying Input and Output Streams Together</h5>
<p>When an input stream is tied to an output stream, any attempt to read the input stream will first flush the buffer associated with the output stream. The library ties <code>cout</code> to <code>cin</code>, so the statement</p>

```c++
cin >> ival;
```

<p>causes the buffer associated with <code>cout</code> to be flushed.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>Interactive systems usually should tie their input stream to their output stream. Doing so means that all output, which might include prompts to the user, will be written before attempting to read the input.</p>
:::

<p>There are two overloaded (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">6.4</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1597234">230</a>) versions of <code>tie:</code> One version takes no argument and returns a pointer to the output stream, if any, to which this object is currently tied. The function returns the null pointer if the stream is not tied.</p>
<p><a id="filepos2108081"></a>The second version of <code>tie</code> takes a pointer to an <code>ostream</code> and ties itself to that <code>ostream</code>. That is, <code>x.tie(&amp;o)</code> ties the stream <code>x</code> to the output stream <code>o</code>.</p>
<p>We can tie either an <code>istream</code> or an <code>ostream</code> object to another <code>ostream</code>:</p>

```c++
cin.tie(&cout);   // illustration only: the library ties cin and cout for us
// old_tie points to the stream (if any) currently tied to cin
ostream *old_tie = cin.tie(nullptr); // cin is no longer tied
// ties cin and cerr; not a good idea because cin should be tied to cout
cin.tie(&cerr);   // reading cin flushes cerr, not cout
cin.tie(old_tie); // reestablish normal tie between cin and cout
```

<p>To tie a given stream to a new output stream, we pass <code>tie</code> a pointer to the new stream. To untie the stream completely, we pass a null pointer. Each stream can be tied to at most one stream at a time. However, multiple streams can tie themselves to the same <code>ostream</code>.</p>

<h3 id="filepos1307896">5.4. Iterative Statements</h3>
<p>Iterative statements, commonly called loops, provide for repeated execution until a condition is true. The <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> statements test the condition before executing the body. The <code>do while</code> executes the body and then tests its condition.</p>
<h4 id="filepos1308478">5.4.1. The <code>while</code> Statement</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>A <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1412397" id="filepos1308797"><code>while</code>
<strong>statement</strong></a> repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a condition is true. Its syntactic form is</p>

```c++
while (condition)
      statement
```

<p>In a <code>while</code>, <em>statement</em> (which is often a block) is executed as long as <em>condition</em> evaluates as <code>true</code>. <em>condition</em> may not be empty. If the first evaluation of <em>condition</em> yields <code>false</code>, <em>statement</em> is not executed.</p>
<p>The condition can be an expression or an initialized variable declaration (§ <a href="055-5.2._statement_scope.html#filepos1244991">5.2</a>, p. <a href="055-5.2._statement_scope.html#filepos1244991">174</a>). Ordinarily, the condition itself or the loop body must do something to change the value of the expression. Otherwise, the loop might never terminate.</p>

<p>Variables defined in a <code>while</code> condition or <code>while</code> body are created and destroyed on each iteration.</p>

<h5>Using a <code>while</code> Loop</h5>
<p>A <code>while</code> loop is generally used when we want to iterate indefinitely, such as when we read input. A <code>while</code> is also useful when we want access to the value of the loop control variable after the loop finishes. For example:</p>

<a id="filepos1311553"></a><p>Code for Exercise 5.13</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong>
<code>unsigned aCnt = 0, eCnt = 0, iouCnt = 0;</code></p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong>
<code>unsigned index = some_value();</code></p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong>
<code>unsigned evenCnt = 0, oddCnt = 0;</code></p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong>
<code>unsigned ival=512, jval=1024, kval=4096;</code></p>
:::

<p><a id="filepos1314901"></a></p>

```c++
vector<int> v;
int i;
// read until end-of-file or other input failure
while (cin >> i)
    v.push_back(i);
// find the first negative element
auto beg = v.begin();
while (beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0)
    ++beg;
if (beg == v.end())
    // we know that all elements in v are greater than or equal to zero
```

<p>The first loop reads data from the standard input. We have no idea how many times this loop will execute. The condition fails when <code>cin</code> reads invalid data, encounters some other input failure, or hits end-of-file. The second loop continues until we find a negative value. When the loop terminates, <code>beg</code> is either equal to <code>v.end()</code>, or it denotes an element in <code>v</code> whose value is less than zero. We can use the state of <code>beg</code> outside the <code>while</code> to determine further processing.</p>

The program should find places in the input where one word is followed immediately by itself. Keep track of the largest number of times a single repetition occurs and which word is repeated. Print the maximum number of duplicates, or else print a message saying that no word was repeated. For example, if the input is</p>

<h4 id="filepos1317901">5.4.2. Traditional <code>for</code> Statement</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>The syntactic form of the <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1407052" id="filepos1318250"><code>for</code>
<strong>statement</strong></a> is:</p>

```c++
for (init-statement condition; expression)
    statement
```

<p>The <code>for</code> and the part inside the parentheses is often referred to as the <code>for</code> header.</p>

::: info
<p><em>init-statement</em> must be a declaration statement, an expression statement, or a null statement. Each of these statements ends with a semicolon, so the syntactic form can also be thought of as</p>
:::

```c++
for (initializer; condition; expression)
      statement
```

<p>In general, <em>init-statement</em> is used to initialize or assign a starting value that is modified over the course of the loop. <em>condition</em> serves as the loop control. As long as <em>condition</em> evaluates as <code>true</code>, <em>statement</em> is executed. If the first evaluation <a id="filepos1320438"></a>of <em>condition</em> yields <code>false</code>, <em>statement</em> is not executed. <em>expression</em> usually modifies the variable(s) initialized in <em>init-statement</em> and tested in <em>condition. expression</em> is evaluated after each iteration of the loop. As usual, <em>statement</em> can be either a single or a compound statement.</p>
<h5>Execution Flow in a Traditional <code>for</code> Loop</h5>
<p>Given the following <code>for</code> loop from § <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">3.2.3</a> (p. <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">94</a>):</p>

```c++
// process characters in s until we run out of characters or we hit a whitespace
for (decltype(s.size()) index = 0;
     index != s.size() && !isspace(s[index]); ++index)
        s[index] = toupper(s[index]); // capitalize the current character
```

<p>the order of evaluation is as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p><em>init-statement</em> is executed once at the start of the loop. In this example, <code>index</code> is defined and initialized to zero.</p></li>
    <li>Next, <em>condition</em> is evaluated. If <code>index</code> is not equal to <code>s.size()</code> and the character at <code>s[index]</code> is not whitespace, the <code>for</code> body is executed. Otherwise, the loop terminates. If the condition is <code>false</code> on the first iteration, then the <code>for</code> body is not executed at all.</li>
    <li>If the condition is <code>true</code>, the <code>for</code> body executes. In this case, the <code>for</code> body makes the character at <code>s[index]</code> uppercase.</li>
    <li>Finally, <em>expression</em> is evaluated. In this example, <code>index</code> is incremented by 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four steps represent the first iteration of the <code>for</code> loop. Step 1 is executed only once on entry to the loop. Steps 2, 3, and 4 are repeated until the condition evaluates as <code>false</code>—that is, when we encounter a whitespace character in <code>s</code>, or <code>index</code> is greater than <code>s.size()</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>It is worth remembering that the visibility of any object defined within the <code>for</code> header is limited to the body of the <code>for</code> loop. Thus, in this example, <code>index</code> is inaccessible after the <code>for</code> completes.</p>
:::

<h5>Multiple Definitions in the <code>for</code> Header</h5>
<p>As in any other declaration, <em>init-statement</em> can define several objects. However, <em>init-statement</em> may be only a single declaration statement. Therefore, all the variables must have the same base type (§ <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos394806">2.3</a>, p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos394806">50</a>). As one example, we might write a loop to duplicate the elements of a <code>vector</code> on the end as follows:</p>

```c++
// remember the size of v and stop when we get to the original last element
for (decltype(v.size()) i = 0, sz = v.size(); i != sz; ++i)
    v.push_back(v[i]);
```

<p>In this loop we define both the index, <code>i</code>, and the loop control, <code>sz</code>, in <em>init-statement</em>.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos1327423"></a>Omitting Parts of the <code>for</code> Header</h5>
<p>A <code>for</code> header can omit any (or all) of <em>init-statement</em>, <em>condition</em>, or <em>expression</em>.</p>
<p>We can use a null statement for <em>init-statement</em> when an initialization is unnecessary. For example, we might rewrite the loop that looked for the first negative number in a <code>vector</code> so that it uses a <code>for</code>:</p>

```c++
auto beg = v.begin();
for ( /* null */; beg != v.end() && *beg >= 0; ++beg)
    ; // no work to do
```

<p>Note that the semicolon is necessary to indicate the absence of <em>init-statement</em>—more precisely, the semicolon represents a null <em>init-statement</em>. In this loop, the <code>for</code> body is also empty because all the work of the loop is done inside the <code>for</code> condition and expression. The condition decides when it’s time to stop looking and the expression increments the iterator.</p>
<p>Omitting <em>condition</em> is equivalent to writing <code>true</code> as the condition. Because the condition always evaluates as <code>true</code>, the <code>for</code> body must contain a statement that exits the loop. Otherwise the loop will execute indefinitely:</p>

```c++
for (int i = 0; /* no condition */ ; ++i) {
    // process i; code inside the loop must stop the iteration!
}
```

<p>We can also omit <em>expression</em> from the <code>for</code> header. In such loops, either the condition or the body must do something to advance the iteration. As an example, we’ll rewrite the <code>while</code> loop that read input into a <code>vector</code> of <code>int</code>s:</p>

```c++
vector<int> v;
for (int i; cin >> i; /* no expression */ )
   v.push_back(i);
```

<p>In this loop there is no need for an expression because the condition changes the value of <code>i</code>. The condition tests the input stream so that the loop ends when we’ve read all the input or encounter an input error.</p>
<h4 id="filepos1331917">5.4.3. Range <code>for</code> Statement</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>The new standard introduced a simpler <code>for</code> statement that can be used to iterate through the elements of a container or other sequence. The syntactic form of the <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1409636" id="filepos1332466">range <code>for</code> statement</a></strong> is:</p>

```c++
for (declaration : expression)
    statement
```

<a id="filepos1333046"></a><Badge type="tip" text="C++11" />
<p><em>expression</em> must represent a sequence, such as a braced initializer list (§ <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos744172">3.3.1</a>, p. <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos744172">98</a>), an array (§ <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos853883">3.5</a>, p. <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos853883">113</a>), or an object of a type such as <code>vector</code> or <code>string</code> that has <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> members that return iterators (§ <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos802543">3.4</a>, p. <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos802543">106</a>).</p>
<p><em>declaration</em> defines a variable.

<p><strong>Exercise 5.15:</strong> Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect.</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong>
<code>for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix)  { /* </code></p>

<code>int ix;</code></p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong>
<code>for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix, ++ sz)  { /*</code>
. . .
<code>*/ }</code></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5.16:</strong> The <code>while</code> loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file. The <code>for</code> loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5.17:</strong> Given two <code>vector</code>s of <code>int</code>s, write a program to determine whether one <code>vector</code> is a prefix of the other. For <code>vector</code>s of unequal length, compare the number of elements of the smaller <code>vector</code>. For example, given the <code>vector</code>s containing <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code> and <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>8</code>, respectively your program should return <code>true</code>.</p>
:::

<p>types match is to use the <code>auto</code> type specifier (§ <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos544751">2.5.2</a>, p. <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos544751">68</a>). That way the compiler will deduce the type for us. If we want to write to the elements in the sequence, the loop variable must be a reference type.</p>
<p>On each iteration, the control variable is defined and initialized by the next value in the sequence, after which <em>statement</em> is executed. As usual, <em>statement</em> can be a single statement or a block. Execution ends once all the elements have been processed.</p>
<p>We have already seen several such loops, but for completeness, here is one that doubles the value of each element in a <code>vector</code>:</p>

```c++
vector<int> v = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
// range variable must be a reference so we can write to the elements
for (auto &r : v)   // for each element in v
    r *= 2;         // double the value of each element in v
```

<p>The <code>for</code> header declares the loop control variable, <code>r</code>, and associates it with <code>v</code>. We use <code>auto</code> to let the compiler infer the correct type for <code>r</code>. Because we want to change the value of the elements in <code>v</code>, we declare <code>r</code> as a reference. When we assign to <code>r</code> inside the loop, that assignment changes the element to which <code>r</code> is bound.</p>
<p>A range <code>for</code> is defined in terms of the equivalent traditional <code>for</code>:</p>

```c++
for (auto beg = v.begin(), end = v.end(); beg != end; ++beg) {
    auto &r = *beg; // r must be a reference so we can change the element
    r *= 2;         // double the value of each element in v
}
```

<p>Now that we know how a range <code>for</code> works, we can understand why we said in § <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos767585">3.3.2</a> (p. <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos767585">101</a>) that we cannot use a range <code>for</code> to add elements to a <code>vector</code> (or <a id="filepos1342506"></a>other container). In a range <code>for</code>, the value of <code>end()</code> is cached. If we add elements to (or remove them from) the sequence, the value of <code>end</code> might be invalidated (§ <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos804727">3.4.1</a>, p. <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos804727">110</a>). We’ll have more to say about these matters in § <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2331099">9.3.6</a> (p. <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2331099">353</a>).</p>
<h4 id="filepos1343100">5.4.4. The <code>do while</code> Statement</h4>
<p>A <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1404711" id="filepos1343362"><code>do while</code>
<strong>statement</strong></a> is like a <code>while</code> but the condition is tested after the statement body completes. Regardless of the value of the condition, we execute the loop at least once. The syntactic form is as follows:</p>

```c++
do
        statement
while (condition);
```

::: info
<p>A <code>do while</code> ends with a semicolon after the parenthesized condition.</p>
:::

<p>In a <code>do</code>, <em>statement</em> is executed before <em>condition</em> is evaluated. <em>condition</em> cannot be empty. If <em>condition</em> evaluates as <code>false</code>, then the loop terminates; otherwise, the loop is repeated. Variables used in <em>condition</em> must be defined outside the body of the <code>do while</code> statement.</p>
<p>We can write a program that (indefinitely) does sums using a <code>do while</code>:</p>

```c++
// repeatedly ask the user for a pair of numbers to sum
string rsp;  // used in the condition; can't be defined inside the do
do {
    cout << "please enter two values: ";
    int val1 = 0, val2 = 0;
    cin  >> val1 >> val2;
    cout << "The sum of " << val1 << " and " << val2
         << " = " << val1 + val2 << "\n\n"
         << "More? Enter yes or no: ";
    cin  >> rsp;
} while (!rsp.empty() && rsp[0] != 'n');
```

<p>The loop starts by prompting the user for two numbers. It then prints their sum and asks whether the user wishes to do another sum. The condition checks that the user gave a response. If not, or if the input starts with an <code>n</code>, the loop is exited. Otherwise the loop is repeated.</p>
<p>Because the condition is not evaluated until after the statement or block is executed, the <code>do while</code> loop does not allow variable definitions inside the condition:</p>

```c++
do {
    // . . .
    mumble(foo);
} while (int foo = get_foo()); // error: declaration in a do condition
```

<p>If we could define variables in the condition, then any use of the variable would happen <em>before</em> the variable was defined!</p>

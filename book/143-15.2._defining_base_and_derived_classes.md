<h3 id="filepos3795765">15.2. Defining Base and Derived Classes</h3>
<p>In many, but not all, ways base and derived classes are defined like other classes we have already seen. In this section, we’ll cover the basic features used to define classes related by inheritance.</p>
<h4 id="filepos3796139">15.2.1. Defining a Base Class</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>We’ll start by completing the definition of our <code>Quote</code> class:</p>

```c++
class Quote {
public:
    Quote() = default;  // = default see § 7.1.4 (p. 264)
    Quote(const std::string &book, double sales_price):
                     bookNo(book), price(sales_price) { }
    std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; }
    // returns the total sales price for the specified number of items
    // derived classes will override and apply different discount algorithms
    virtual double net_price(std::size_t n) const
               { return n * price; }
    virtual ~Quote() = default; // dynamic binding for the destructor
private:
    std::string bookNo; // ISBN number of this item
protected:
    double price = 0.0; // normal, undiscounted price
};
```

<p>The new parts in this class are the use of <code>virtual</code> on the <code>net_price</code> function and the destructor, and the <code>protected</code> access specifier. We’ll explain virtual destructors in §<a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos3974566">15.7.1</a> (p. <a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos3974566">622</a>), but for now it is worth noting that classes used as the root of an inheritance hierarchy almost always define a virtual destructor.</p>

::: info
<p>Base classes ordinarily should define a virtual destructor. Virtual destructors are needed even if they do no work.</p>
:::

<h5>Member Functions and Inheritance</h5>
<p>Derived classes inherit the members of their base class. However, a derived class needs to be able to provide its own definition for operations, such as <code>net_price</code>, <a id="filepos3799829"></a>that are type dependent. In such cases, the derived class needs to <strong>override</strong> the definition it inherits from the base class, by providing its own definition.</p>
<p>In C++, a base class must distinguish the functions it expects its derived classes to override from those that it expects its derived classes to inherit without change. The base class defines as <code>virtual</code> those functions it expects its derived classes to override. When we call a virtual function <em>through a pointer or reference</em>, the call will be dynamically bound. Depending on the type of the object to which the reference or pointer is bound, the version in the base class or in one of its derived classes will be executed.</p>
<p>A base class specifies that a member function should be dynamically bound by preceding its declaration with the keyword <code>virtual</code>. Any non<code>static</code> member function (§<a href="078-7.6._static_class_members.html#filepos2028441">7.6</a>, p. <a href="078-7.6._static_class_members.html#filepos2028441">300</a>), other than a constructor, may be virtual. The <code>virtual</code> keyword appears only on the declaration inside the class and may not be used on a function definition that appears outside the class body. A function that is declared as <code>virtual</code> in the base class is implicitly <code>virtual</code> in the derived classes as well. We’ll have more to say about virtual functions in §<a href="144-15.3._virtual_functions.html#filepos3853256">15.3</a> (p. <a href="144-15.3._virtual_functions.html#filepos3853256">603</a>).</p>
<p>Member functions that are not declared as <code>virtual</code> are resolved at compile time, not run time. For the <code>isbn</code> member, this is exactly the behavior we want. The <code>isbn</code> function does not depend on the details of a derived type. It behaves identically when run on a <code>Quote</code> or <code>Bulk_quote</code> object. There will be only one version of the <code>isbn</code> function in our inheritance hierarchy. Thus, there is no question as to which function to run when we call <code>isbn()</code>.</p>
<h5>Access Control and Inheritance</h5>
<p>A derived class inherits the members defined in its base class. However, the member functions in a derived class may not necessarily access the members that are inherited from the base class. Like any other code that uses the base class, a derived class may access the <code>public</code> members of its base class but may not access the <code>private</code> members. However, sometimes a base class has members that it wants to let its derived classes use while still prohibiting access to those same members by other users. We specify such members after a <code>protected</code> access specifier.</p>
<p>Our <code>Quote</code> class expects its derived classes to define their own <code>net_price</code> function. To do so, those classes need access to the <code>price</code> member. As a result, <code>Quote</code> defines that member as <code>protected</code>. Derived classes are expected to access <code>bookNo</code> in the same way as ordinary users—by calling the <code>isbn</code> function. Hence, the <code>bookNo</code> member is <code>private</code> and is inaccessible to classes that inherit from <code>Quote</code>. We’ll have more to say about <code>protected</code> members in §<a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a> (p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">611</a>).</p>

:::

<h4 id="filepos3806030"><a id="filepos3806063"></a>15.2.2. Defining a Derived Class</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>A derived class must specify from which class(es) it inherits. It does so in its <strong>class derivation list</strong>, which is a colon followed by a comma-separated list of names of previously defined classes. Each base class name may be preceded by an optional access specifier, which is one of <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>private</code>.</p>
<p>A derived class must declare each inherited member function it intends to override. Therefore, our <code>Bulk_quote</code> class must include a <code>net_price</code> member:</p>

```c++
class Bulk_quote : public Quote { // Bulk_quote inherits from Quote
    Bulk_quote() = default;
    Bulk_quote(const std::string&, double, std::size_t, double);
    // overrides the base version in order to implement the bulk purchase discount policy
    double net_price(std::size_t) const override;
private:
    std::size_t min_qty = 0; // minimum purchase for the discount to apply
    double discount = 0.0;   // fractional discount to apply
};
```

<p>Our <code>Bulk_quote</code> class inherits the <code>isbn</code> function and the <code>bookNo</code> and <code>price</code> data members of its <code>Quote</code> base class. It defines its own version of <code>net_price</code> and has two additional data members, <code>min_qty</code> and <code>discount</code>. These members specify the minimum quantity and the discount to apply once that number of copies are purchased.</p>
<p>We’ll have more to say about the access specifier used in a derivation list in §<a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a> (p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">612</a>). For now, what’s useful to know is that the access specifier determines whether users of a derived class are allowed to know that the derived class inherits from its base class.</p>
<p>When the derivation is <code>public</code>, the <code>public</code> members of the base class become part of the interface of the derived class as well. In addition, we can bind an object of a publicly derived type to a pointer or reference to the base type. Because we used <code>public</code> in the derivation list, the interface to <code>Bulk_quote</code> implicitly contains the <code>isbn</code> function, and we may use a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object where a pointer or reference to <code>Quote</code> is expected.</p>
<p>Most classes inherit directly from only one base class. This form of inheritance, known as “single inheritance,” forms the topic of this chapter. §<a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5026780">18.3</a> (p. <a href="173-18.3._multiple_and_virtual_inheritance.html#filepos5026780">802</a>) will cover classes that have derivation lists with more than one base class.</p>
<h5>Virtual Functions in the Derived Class</h5>
<p>Derived classes frequently, but not always, override the virtual functions that they inherit. If a derived class does not override a virtual from its base, then, like any other member, the derived class inherits the version defined in its base class.</p>
<a id="filepos3811456"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>A derived class may include the <code>virtual</code> keyword on the functions it overrides, but it is not required to do so. For reasons we’ll explain in §<a href="144-15.3._virtual_functions.html#filepos3853256">15.3</a> (p. <a href="144-15.3._virtual_functions.html#filepos3853256">606</a>), the new standard lets a derived class explicitly note that it intends a member function to override a virtual that it inherits. It does so by specifying <code>override</code> after the parameter list, or after the <code>const</code> or reference qualifier(s) if the member is a <code>const</code> (§<a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1761316">7.1.2</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1761316">258</a>) or reference (§<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3505762">13.6.3</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3505762">546</a>) function.</p>
<h5>Derived-Class Objects and the Derived-to-Base Conversion</h5>
<p><a id="filepos3812642"></a>A derived object contains multiple parts: a subobject containing the (non<code>static</code>) members defined in the derived class itself, plus subobjects corresponding to each base class from which the derived class inherits. Thus, a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object will contain four data elements: the <code>bookNo</code> and <code>price</code> data members that it inherits from <code>Quote</code>, and the <code>min_qty</code> and <code>discount</code> members, which are defined by <code>Bulk_quote</code>.</p>
<p>Although the standard does not specify how derived objects are laid out in memory, we can think of a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object as consisting of two parts as represented in <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3813939">Figure 15.1</a>.</p>
<a id="filepos3813939"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00102.jpg"/>
<p>Figure 15.1. Conceptual Structure of a <code>Bulk_quote</code> Object</p>
<p><strong>The base and derived parts of an object are not guaranteed to be stored contiguously. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3813939">Figure 15.1</a> is a conceptual, not physical, representation of how classes work.</strong></p>
<p>Because a derived object contains subparts corresponding to its base class(es), we can use an object of a derived type <em>as if</em> it were an object of its base type(s). In particular, we can bind a base-class reference or pointer to the base-class part of a derived object.</p>

```c++
Quote item;        //  object of base type
Bulk_quote bulk;   //  object of derived type
Quote *p = &item;  //  p points to a Quote object
p = &bulk;         //  p points to the Quote part of bulk
Quote &r = bulk;   //  r bound to the Quote part of bulk
```

<p>This conversion is often referred to as the <strong><a href="152-defined_terms.html#filepos4142654" id="filepos3816769">derived-to-base</a></strong> conversion. As with any other conversion, the compiler will apply the derived-to-base conversion implicitly (§<a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1157818">4.11</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1157818">159</a>).</p>
<p>The fact that the derived-to-base conversion is implicit means that we can use an object of derived type or a reference to a derived type when a reference to the base type is required. Similarly, we can use a pointer to a derived type where a pointer to the base type is required.</p>

::: info
<p>The fact that a derived object contains subobjects for its base classes is key to how inheritance works.</p>
:::

<h5><a id="filepos3817863"></a>Derived-Class Constructors</h5>
<p>Although a derived object contains members that it inherits from its base, it cannot directly initialize those members. Like any other code that creates an object of the base-class type, a derived class must use a base-class constructor to initialize its base-class part.</p>

::: info
<p>Each class controls how its members are initialized.</p>
:::

<p>The base-class part of an object is initialized, along with the data members of the derived class, during the initialization phase of the constructor (§<a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1953073">7.5.1</a>, p. <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1953073">288</a>). Analogously to how we initialize a member, a derived-class constructor uses its constructor initializer list to pass arguments to a base-class constructor. For example, the <code>Bulk_quote</code> constructor with four parameters:</p>

```c++
Bulk_quote(const std::string& book, double p,
           std::size_t qty, double disc) :
           Quote(book, p), min_qty(qty), discount(disc) { }
    // as before
};
```

<p>passes its first two parameters (representing the <small>ISBN</small> and price) to the <code>Quote</code> constructor. That <code>Quote</code> constructor initializes the <code>Bulk_quote</code>’s base-class part (i.e., the <code>bookNo</code> and <code>price</code> members). When the (empty) <code>Quote</code> constructor body completes, the base-class part of the object being constructed will have been initialized. Next the direct members, <code>min_qty</code> and <code>discount</code>, are initialized. Finally, the (empty) function body of the <code>Bulk_quote</code> constructor is run.</p>
<p>As with a data member, unless we say otherwise, the base part of a derived object is default initialized. To use a different base-class constructor, we provide a constructor initializer using the name of the base class, followed (as usual) by a parenthesized list of arguments. Those arguments are used to select which base-class constructor to use to initialize the base-class part of the derived object.</p>

::: info
<p>The base class is initialized first, and then the members of the derived class are initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class.</p>
:::

<h5>Using Members of the Base Class from the Derived Class</h5>
<p>A derived class may access the <code>public</code> and <code>protected</code> members of its base class:</p>

```c++
// if the specified number of items are purchased, use the discounted price
double Bulk_quote::net_price(size_t cnt) const
{
    if (cnt >= min_qty)
        return cnt * (1 - discount) * price;
    else
        return cnt * price;
}
```

<p><a id="filepos3823114"></a>This function generates a discounted price: If the given quantity is more than <code>min_qty</code>, we apply the <code>discount</code> (which was stored as a fraction) to the <code>price</code>.</p>
<p>We’ll have more to say about scope in §<a href="147-15.6._class_scope_under_inheritance.html#filepos3941072">15.6</a> (p. <a href="147-15.6._class_scope_under_inheritance.html#filepos3941072">617</a>), but for now it’s worth knowing that the scope of a derived class is nested inside the scope of its base class. As a result, there is no distinction between how a member of the derived class uses members defined in its own class (e.g., <code>min_qty</code> and <code>discount</code>) and how it uses members defined in its base (e.g., <code>price</code>).</p>

::: info
<p>Key Concept: Respecting the Base-Class Interface</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that each class defines its own interface. Interactions with an object of a class-type should use the interface of that class, even if that object is the base-class part of a derived object.</p>
<p>As a result, derived-class constructors may not directly initialize the members of its base class. The constructor body of a derived constructor can assign values to its <code>public</code> or <code>protected</code> base-class members. Although it <em>can</em> assign to those members, it generally <em>should not</em> do so. Like any other user of the base class, a derived class should respect the interface of its base class by using a constructor to initialize its inherited members.</p>
:::

<h5>Inheritance and <code>static</code> Members</h5>
<p>If a base class defines a <code>static</code> member (§<a href="078-7.6._static_class_members.html#filepos2028441">7.6</a>, p. <a href="078-7.6._static_class_members.html#filepos2028441">300</a>), there is only one such member defined for the entire hierarchy. Regardless of the number of classes derived from a base class, there exists a single instance of each <code>static</code> member.</p>

```c++
class Base {
public:
    static void statmem();
};
class Derived : public Base {
    void f(const Derived&);
};
```

<p><code>static</code> members obey normal access control. If the member is <code>private</code> in the base class, then derived classes have no access to it. Assuming the member is accessible, we can use a <code>static</code> member through either the base or derived:</p>

```c++
void Derived::f(const Derived &derived_obj)
{
    Base::statmem();    // ok: Base defines statmem
    Derived::statmem(); // ok: Derived inherits statmem
    // ok: derived objects can be used to access static from base
    derived_obj.statmem(); // accessed through a Derived object
    statmem();             // accessed through this object
}
```

<h5><a id="filepos3828987"></a>Declarations of Derived Classes</h5>
<p>A derived class is declared like any other class (§<a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1897012">7.3.3</a>, p. <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1897012">278</a>). The declaration contains the class name but does not include its derivation list:</p>

```c++
class Bulk_quote : public Quote; // error: derivation list can't appear here
class Bulk_quote;                // ok: right way to declare a derived class
```

<p>The purpose of a declaration is to make known that a name exists and what kind of entity it denotes, for example, a class, function, or variable. The derivation list, and all other details of the definition, must appear together in the class body.</p>
<h5>Classes Used as a Base Class</h5>
<p>A class must be defined, not just declared, before we can use it as a base class:</p>

```c++
class Quote;   // declared but not defined
// error: Quote must be defined
class Bulk_quote : public Quote { ... };
```

<p>The reason for this restriction should be easy to see: Each derived class contains, and may use, the members it inherits from its base class. To use those members, the derived class must know what they are. One implication of this rule is that it is impossible to derive a class from itself.</p>
<p>A base class can itself be a derived class:</p>

```c++
class Base { /* ... */ } ;
class D1: public Base { /* ... */ };
class D2: public D1 { /* ... */ };
```

<p>In this hierarchy, <code>Base</code> is a <strong><a href="152-defined_terms.html#filepos4142981" id="filepos3832397">direct base</a></strong> to <code>D1</code> and an <strong><a href="152-defined_terms.html#filepos4144331" id="filepos3832546">indirect base</a></strong> to <code>D2</code>. A direct base class is named in the derivation list. An indirect base is one that a derived class inherits through its direct base class.</p>
<p>Each class inherits all the members of its direct base class. The most derived class inherits the members of its direct base. The members in the direct base include those it inherits from its base class, and so on up the inheritance chain. Effectively, the most derived object contains a subobject for its direct base and for each of its indirect bases.</p>
<h5>Preventing Inheritance</h5>
<a id="filepos3833370"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>Sometimes we define a class that we don’t want others to inherit from. Or we might define a class for which we don’t want to think about whether it is appropriate as a base class. Under the new standard, we can prevent a class from being used as a base by following the class name with <code>final</code>:</p>

```c++
class NoDerived final { /*  */ }; // NoDerived can't be a base class
class Base { /*  */ };
// Last is final; we cannot inherit from Last
class Last final : Base { /*  */ }; // Last can't be a base class
class Bad : NoDerived { /*  */ };   // error: NoDerived is final
class Bad2 : Last { /*  */ };       // error: Last is final
```

<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>

::: warning
<p>Understanding conversions between base and derived classes is essential to understanding how object-oriented programming works in C++.</p>
:::

<p>Ordinarily, we can bind a reference or a pointer only to an object that has the same type as the corresponding reference or pointer (§<a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos396246">2.3.1</a>, p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos396246">51</a>, and §<a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">2.3.2</a>, p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">52</a>) or to a type that involves an acceptable <code>const</code> conversion (§<a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1178431">4.11.2</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1178431">162</a>). Classes related by inheritance are an important exception: We can bind a pointer or reference to a base-class type to an object of a type derived from that base class. For example, we can use a <code>Quote&amp;</code> to refer to a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object, and we can assign the address of a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object to a <code>Quote*</code>.</p>
<p>The fact that we can bind a reference (or pointer) to a base-class type to a derived object has a crucially important implication: When we use a reference (or pointer) to a base-class type, we don’t know the actual type of the object to which the pointer or reference is bound. That object can be an object of the base class or it can be an object of a derived class.</p>

::: info
<p>Like built-in pointers, the smart pointer classes (§<a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2904799">12.1</a>, p. <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2904799">450</a>) support the derived-to-base conversion—we can store a pointer to a derived object in a smart pointer to the base type.</p>
:::

<h5>Static Type and Dynamic Type</h5>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>When we use types related by inheritance, we often need to distinguish between the <strong><a href="152-defined_terms.html#filepos4149491" id="filepos3840881">static type</a></strong> of a variable or other expression and the <strong><a href="152-defined_terms.html#filepos4143767" id="filepos3840996">dynamic type</a></strong> of the object that expression represents. The static type of an expression is always known at compile time—it is the type with which a variable is declared or that an expression yields. The dynamic type is the type of the object in memory that the variable or expression represents. The dynamic type may not be known until run time.</p>
<p><a id="filepos3841465"></a>For example, when <code>print_total</code> calls <code>net_price</code> (§<a href="142-15.1._oop_an_overview.html#filepos3782427">15.1</a>, p. <a href="142-15.1._oop_an_overview.html#filepos3782427">593</a>):</p>

```c++
double ret = item.net_price(n);
```

<p>we know that the static type of <code>item</code> is <code>Quote&amp;</code>. The dynamic type depends on the type of the argument to which <code>item</code> is bound. That type cannot be known until a call is executed at run time. If we pass a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object to <code>print_total</code>, then the static type of <code>item</code> will differ from its dynamic type. As we’ve seen, the static type of <code>item</code> is <code>Quote&amp;</code>, but in this case the dynamic type is <code>Bulk_quote</code>.</p>
<p>The dynamic type of an expression that is neither a reference nor a pointer is always the same as that expression’s static type. For example, a variable of type <code>Quote</code> is always a <code>Quote</code> object; there is nothing we can do that will change the type of the object to which that variable corresponds.</p>

::: info
<p>It is crucial to understand that the static type of a pointer or reference to a base class may differ from its dynamic type.</p>
:::

<h5>There Is No Implicit Conversion from Base to Derived ...</h5>
<p>The conversion from derived to base exists because every derived object contains a base-class part to which a pointer or reference of the base-class type can be bound. There is no similar guarantee for base-class objects. A base-class object can exist either as an independent object or as part of a derived object. A base object that is not part of a derived object has only the members defined by the base class; it doesn’t have the members defined by the derived class.</p>
<p>Because a base object might or might not be part of a derived object, there is no automatic conversion from the base class to its derived class(s):</p>

```c++
Quote base;
Bulk_quote* bulkP = &base;  // error: can't convert base to derived
Bulk_quote& bulkRef = base; // error: can't convert base to derived
```

<p>If these assignments were legal, we might attempt to use <code>bulkP</code> or <code>bulkRef</code> to use members that do not exist in <code>base</code>.</p>
<p>What is sometimes a bit surprising is that we cannot convert from base to derived even when a base pointer or reference is bound to a derived object:</p>

```c++
Bulk_quote bulk;
Quote *itemP = &bulk;        // ok: dynamic type is Bulk_quote
Bulk_quote *bulkP = itemP;   // error: can't convert base to derived
```

<p>The compiler has no way to know (at compile time) that a specific conversion will be safe at run time. The compiler looks only at the static types of the pointer or reference to determine whether a conversion is legal. If the base class has one or more virtual functions, we can use a <code>dynamic_cast</code> (which we’ll cover in §<a href="178-19.2._runtime_type_identification.html#filepos5161190">19.2.1</a> (p. <a href="178-19.2._runtime_type_identification.html#filepos5161190">825</a>)) to request a conversion that is checked at run time. Alternatively, in those cases when we <em>know</em> that the conversion from base to derived is safe, we can use a <code>static_cast</code> (§<a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1189032">4.11.3</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1189032">162</a>) to override the compiler.</p>

<p>The automatic derived-to-base conversion applies only for conversions to a reference or pointer type. There is no such conversion from a derived-class type to the base-class type. Nevertheless, it is often possible to convert an object of a derived class to its base-class type. However, such conversions may not behave as we might want.</p>
<p>Remember that when we initialize or assign an object of a class type, we are actually calling a function. When we initialize, we’re calling a constructor (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3203084">13.1.1</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3203084">496</a>, and §<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">534</a>); when we assign, we’re calling an assignment operator (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">13.1.2</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">500</a>, and §<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">536</a>). These members normally have a parameter that is a reference to the <code>const</code> version of the class type.</p>
<p>Because these members take references, the derived-to-base conversion lets us pass a derived object to a base-class copy/move operation. These operations are not virtual. When we pass a derived object to a base-class constructor, the constructor that is run is defined in the base class. That constructor knows <em>only</em> about the members of the base class itself. Similarly, if we assign a derived object to a base object, the assignment operator that is run is the one defined in the base class. That operator also knows <em>only</em> about the members of the base class itself.</p>
<p>For example, our bookstore classes use the synthesized versions of copy and assignment (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3203084">13.1.1</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3203084">497</a>, and §<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">13.1.2</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">500</a>). We’ll have more to say about copy control and inheritance in §<a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos3980968">15.7.2</a> (p. <a href="148-15.7._constructors_and_copy_control.html#filepos3980968">623</a>), but for now what’s useful to know is that the synthesized versions memberwise copy or assign the data members of the class the same way as for any other class:</p>

```c++
Bulk_quote bulk;   // object of derived type
Quote item(bulk);  // uses the Quote::Quote(const Quote&) constructor
item = bulk;       // calls Quote::operator=(const Quote&)
```

<p>When <code>item</code> is constructed, the <code>Quote</code> copy constructor is run. That constructor knows only about the <code>bookNo</code> and <code>price</code> members. It copies those members from the <code>Quote</code> part of <code>bulk</code> and <em>ignores</em> the members that are part of the <code>Bulk_quote</code> portion of <code>bulk</code>. Similarly for the assignment of <code>bulk</code> to <code>item</code>; only the <code>Quote</code> part of <code>bulk</code> is assigned to <code>item</code>.</p>
<p>Because the <code>Bulk_quote</code> part is ignored, we say that the <code>Bulk_quote</code> portion of <code>bulk</code> is <strong><a href="152-defined_terms.html#filepos4149088" id="filepos3852622">sliced down</a></strong>.</p>

::: warning
<p>When we initialize or assign an object of a base type from an object of a derived type, only the base-class part of the derived object is copied, moved, or assigned. The derived part of the object is ignored.</p>

<h3 id="filepos802543"><a id="filepos802576"></a>3.4. Introducing Iterators</h3>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Although we can use subscripts to access the characters of a <code>string</code> or the elements in a <code>vector</code>, there is a more general mechanism—known as <strong><a href="037-defined_terms.html#filepos983924" id="filepos803020">iterators</a></strong>—that we can use for the same purpose. As we’ll see in <a href="081-part_ii_the_cpp_library.html#filepos2066884">Part II</a>, in addition to <code>vector</code>, the library defines several other kinds of containers. All of the library containers have iterators, but only a few of them support the subscript operator. Technically speaking, a <code>string</code> is not a container type, but <code>string</code> supports many of the container operations. As we’ve seen <code>string</code>, like <code>vector</code> has a subscript operator. Like <code>vector</code>s, <code>string</code>s also have iterators.</p>
<p>Like pointers (§ <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">2.3.2</a>, p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">52</a>), iterators give us indirect access to an object. In the case of an iterator, that object is an element in a container or a character in a <code>string</code>. We can use an iterator to fetch an element and iterators have operations to move from one element to another. As with pointers, an iterator may be valid or invalid. A valid iterator either denotes an element or denotes a position one past the last element in a container. All other iterator values are invalid.</p>
<h4 id="filepos804727">3.4.1. Using Iterators</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Unlike pointers, we do not use the address-of operator to obtain an iterator. Instead, types that have iterators have members that return iterators. In particular, these types have members named <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>. The <code>begin</code> member returns an iterator that denotes the first element (or first character), if there is one:</p>

```c++
// the compiler determines the type of b and e; see § 2.5.2 (p. 68)
// b denotes the first element and e denotes one past the last element in v
auto b = v.begin(), e = v.end(); // b and e have the same type
```

<p>The iterator returned by <code>end</code> is an iterator positioned “one past the end” of the associated container (or <code>string</code>). This iterator denotes a nonexistent element “off the end” of the container. It is used as a marker indicating when we have processed all the elements. The iterator returned by <code>end</code> is often referred to as the <strong><a href="037-defined_terms.html#filepos985121" id="filepos807668">off-the-end iterator</a></strong> or abbreviated as “the <code>end</code> iterator.” If the container is empty, <code>begin</code> returns the same iterator as the one returned by <code>end</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>If the container is empty, the iterators returned by <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> are equal—they are both off-the-end iterators.</p>
:::

<p>In general, we do not know (or care about) the precise type that an iterator has. In this example, we used <code>auto</code> to define <code>b</code> and <code>e</code> (§ <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos544751">2.5.2</a>, p. <a href="025-2.5._dealing_with_types.html#filepos544751">68</a>). As a result, these variables have whatever type is returned by the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> members, respectively. We’ll have more to say about those types on page <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos815330">108</a>.</p>
<h5>Iterator Operations</h5>
<p>Iterators support only a few operations, which are listed in <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos810064">Table 3.6</a>. We can compare two valid iterators using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>. Iterators are equal if they denote the same element or if they are both off-the-end iterators for the same container. Otherwise, they are unequal.</p>
<p><a id="filepos810064"></a>Table 3.6. Standard Container Iterator Operations</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00027.jpg"/>
<p><a id="filepos810275"></a>As with pointers, we can dereference an iterator to obtain the element denoted by an iterator. Also, like pointers, we may dereference only a valid iterator that denotes an element (§ <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">2.3.2</a>, p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos409391">53</a>). Dereferencing an invalid iterator or an off-the-end iterator has undefined behavior.</p>
<p>As an example, we’ll rewrite the program from § <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">3.2.3</a> (p. <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">94</a>) that capitalized the first character of a <code>string</code> using an iterator instead of a subscript:</p>

```c++
string s("some string");
if (s.begin() != s.end()) { // make sure s is not empty
    auto it = s.begin();    // it denotes the first character in s
    *it = toupper(*it);     // make that character uppercase
}
```

<p>As in our original program, we first check that <code>s</code> isn’t empty. In this case, we do so by comparing the iterators returned by <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>. Those iterators are equal if the <code>string</code> is empty. If they are unequl, there is at least one character in <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>if</code> body, we obtain an iterator to the first character by assigning the iterator returned by <code>begin</code> to <code>it</code>. We dereference that iterator to pass that character to <code>toupper</code>. We also dereference <code>it</code> on the left-hand side of the assignment in order to assign the character returned from <code>toupper</code> to the first character in <code>s</code>. As in our original program, the output of this loop will be:</p>

```
Some string
```

<h5>Moving Iterators from One Element to Another</h5>
<p>Iterators use the increment (<code>++</code>) operator (§ <a href="014-1.4._flow_of_control.html#filepos166704">1.4.1</a>, p. <a href="014-1.4._flow_of_control.html#filepos166704">12</a>) to move from one element to the next. Incrementing an iterator is a logically similar operation to incrementing an integer. In the case of integers, the effect is to “add <code>1</code>” to the integer’s value. In the case of iterators, the effect is to “advance the iterator by one position.”</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>Because the iterator returned from <code>end</code> does not denote an element, it may not be incremented or dereferenced.</p>
:::

<p>Using the increment operator, we can rewrite our program that changed the case of the first word in a <code>string</code> to use iterators instead:</p>
<p><a id="filepos815330"></a></p>

```c++
// process characters in s until we run out of characters or we hit a whitespace
for (auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end() && !isspace(*it); ++it)
    *it = toupper(*it); // capitalize the current character
```

<p>This loop, like the one in § <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">3.2.3</a> (p. <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos697807">94</a>), iterates through the characters in <code>s</code>, stopping when we encounter a whitespace character. However, this loop accesses these characters using an iterator, not a subscript.</p>
<p>The loop starts by initializing <code>it</code> from <code>s.begin</code>, meaning that <code>it</code> denotes the first character (if any) in <code>s</code>. The condition checks whether <code>it</code> has reached the <code>end</code> of <code>s</code>. If not, the condition next dereferences <code>it</code> to pass the current character to <code>isspace</code> to see whether we’re done. At the end of each iteration, we execute <code>++it</code> to advance the iterator to access the next character in <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>The body of this loop, is the same as the last statement in the previous <code>if</code>. We dereference <code>it</code> to pass the current character to <code>toupper</code> and assign the resulting uppercase letter back into the character denoted by <code>it</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Key Concept: Generic Programming</p>
<p>Programmers coming to C++ from C or Java might be surprised that we used <code>!=</code> rather than <code>&lt;</code> in our <code>for</code> loops such as the one above and in the one on page <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos718762">94</a>. C++ programmers use <code>!=</code> as a matter of habit. They do so for the same reason that they use iterators rather than subscripts: This coding style applies equally well to various kinds of containers provided by the library.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, only a few library types, <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> being among them, have the subscript operator. Similarly, all of the library containers have iterators that define the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators. Most of those iterators do not have the <code>&lt;</code> operator. By routinely using iterators and <code>!=</code>, we don’t have to worry about the precise type of container we’re processing.</p>
:::

<h5>Iterator Types</h5>
<p>Just as we do not know the precise type of a <code>vector</code>’s or <code>string</code>’s <code>size_type</code> member (§ <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos659212">3.2.2</a>, p. <a href="031-3.2._library_string_type.html#filepos659212">88</a>), so too, we generally do not know—and do not need to know—the precise type of an iterator. Instead, as with <code>size_type</code>, the library types that have iterators define types named <code>iterator</code> and <code>const_iterator</code> that represent actual iterator types:</p>

```c++
vector<int>::iterator it; // it can read and write vector<int> elements
string::iterator it2;     // it2 can read and write characters in a string
vector<int>::const_iterator it3; // it3 can read but not write elements
string::const_iterator it4;      // it4 can read but not write characters
```

<p>A <code>const_iterator</code> behaves like a <code>const</code> pointer (§ <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos491891">2.4.2</a>, p. <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos491891">62</a>). Like a <code>const</code> pointer, a <code>const_iterator</code> may read but not write the element it denotes; an object of type <code>iterator</code> can both read and write. If a <code>vector</code> or <code>string</code> is <code>const</code>, we may use only its <code>const_iterator</code> type. With a non<code>const vector</code> or <code>string</code>, we can use either <code>iterator</code> or <code>const_iterator</code>.</p>

::: info
<a id="filepos823731"></a><p>Terminology: Iterators and Iterator Types</p>
<p>The term iterator is used to refer to three different entities. We might mean the <em>concept</em> of an iterator, or we might refer to the <code>iterator</code>
<em>type</em> defined by a container, or we might refer to an <em>object</em> as an iterator.</p>
<p>What’s important to understand is that there is a collection of types that are related conceptually. A type is an iterator if it supports a common set of actions. Those actions let us access an element in a container and let us move from one element to another.</p>
<p>Each container class defines a type named <code>iterator;</code> that <code>iterator</code> type supports the actions of an (conceptual) iterator.</p>
:::

<h5>The <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> Operations</h5>
<p>The type returned by <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> depends on whether the object on which they operator is <code>const</code>. If the object is <code>const</code>, then <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> return a <code>const_iterator;</code> if the object is not <code>const</code>, they return <code>iterator</code>:</p>

```c++
vector<int> v;
const vector<int> cv;
auto it1 = v.begin();  // it1 has type vector<int>::iterator
auto it2 = cv.begin(); // it2 has type vector<int>::const_iterator
```

<p>Often this default behavior is not what we want. For reasons we’ll explain in § <a href="064-6.2._argument_passing.html#filepos1479382">6.2.3</a> (p. <a href="064-6.2._argument_passing.html#filepos1479382">213</a>), it is usually best to use a <code>const</code> type (such as <code>const_iterator</code>) when we need to read but do not need to write to an object. To let us ask specifically for the <code>const_iterator</code> type, the new standard introduced two new functions named <code>cbegin</code> and <code>cend</code>:</p>
<a id="filepos827968"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>

```c++
auto it3 = v.cbegin(); // it3 has type vector<int>::const_iterator
```

<p>As do the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> members, these members return iterators to the first and one past the last element in the container. However, regardless of whether the <code>vector</code> (or <code>string</code>) is <code>const</code>, they return a <code>const_iterator</code>.</p>
<h5>Combining Dereference and Member Access</h5>
<p>When we dereference an iterator, we get the object that the iterator denotes. If that object has a class type, we may want to access a member of that object. For example, we might have a <code>vector</code> of <code>string</code>s and we might need to know whether a given element is empty. Assuming <code>it</code> is an iterator into this <code>vector</code>, we can check whether the <code>string</code> that <code>it</code> denotes is empty as follows:</p>

```c++
(*it).empty()
```

<p>For reasons we’ll cover in § <a href="039-4.1._fundamentals.html#filepos1010254">4.1.2</a> (p. <a href="039-4.1._fundamentals.html#filepos1010254">136</a>), the parentheses in <code>(*it).empty()</code> are necessary. The parentheses say to apply the dereference operator to <code>it</code> and to apply the dot operator (§ <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos237516">1.5.2</a>, p. <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos237516">23</a>) to the result of dereferencing <code>it</code>. Without parentheses, the dot operator would apply to <code>it</code>, not to the resulting object:</p>

```c++
(*it).empty() // dereferences it and calls the member empty on the resulting object
*it.empty()   // error: attempts to fetch the member named empty from it
              //     but it is an iterator and has no member named empty
```

<p><a id="filepos832595"></a>The second expression is interpreted as a request to fetch the <code>empty</code> member from the object named <code>it</code>. However, <code>it</code> is an iterator and has no member named <code>empty</code>. Hence, the second expression is in error.</p>
<p>To simplify expressions such as this one, the language defines the arrow operator (the <a href="037-defined_terms.html#filepos991740" id="filepos833208"><code>-&gt;</code>
<strong>operator</strong></a>). The arrow operator combines dereference and member access into a single operation. That is, <code>it-&gt;mem</code> is a synonym for <code>(* it).mem</code>.</p>
<p>For example, assume we have a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> named <code>text</code> that holds the data from a text file. Each element in the <code>vector</code> is either a sentence or an empty <code>string</code> representing a paragraph break. If we want to print the contents of the first paragraph from <code>text</code>, we’d write a loop that iterates through <code>text</code> until we encounter an element that is empty:</p>

```c++
// print each line in text up to the first blank line
for (auto it = text.cbegin();
     it != text.cend() && !it->empty(); ++it)
    cout << *it << endl;
```

<p>We start by initializing <code>it</code> to denote the first element in <code>text</code>. The loop continues until either we process every element in <code>text</code> or we find an element that is empty. So long as there are elements and we haven’t seen an empty element, we print the current element. It is worth noting that because the loop reads but does not write to the elements in <code>text</code>, we use <code>cbegin</code> and <code>cend</code> to control the iteration.</p>
<h5>Some <code>vector</code> Operations Invalidate Iterators</h5>
<p>In § <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos767585">3.3.2</a> (p. <a href="032-3.3._library_vector_type.html#filepos767585">101</a>) we noted that there are implications of the fact that <code>vector</code>s can grow dynamically. We also noted that one such implication is that we cannot add elements to a <code>vector</code> inside a range <code>for</code> loop. Another implication is that any operation, such as <code>push_back</code>, that changes the size of a <code>vector</code> potentially invalidates all iterators into that <code>vector</code>. We’ll explore how iterators become invalid in more detail in § <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2331099">9.3.6</a> (p. <a href="091-9.3._sequential_container_operations.html#filepos2331099">353</a>).</p>

<h4 id="filepos839265"><a id="filepos839298"></a>3.4.2. Iterator Arithmetic</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Incrementing an iterator moves the iterator one element at a time. All the library containers have iterators that support increment. Similarly, we can use <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> to compare two valid iterators (§ <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos802543">3.4</a>, p. <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos802543">106</a>) into any of the library container types.</p>
<p>Iterators for <code>string</code> and <code>vector</code> support additional operations that can move an iterator multiple elements at a time. They also support all the relational operators. These operations, which are often referred to as <strong><a href="037-defined_terms.html#filepos984164" id="filepos840313">iterator arithmetic</a></strong>, are described in <a href="033-3.4._introducing_iterators.html#filepos840512">Table 3.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="filepos840512"></a>Table 3.7. Operations Supported by <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> Iterators</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00028.jpg"/>
<h5>Arithmetic Operations on Iterators</h5>
<p>We can add (or subtract) an integral value and an iterator. Doing so returns an iterator positioned forward (or backward) that many elements. When we add or subtract an integral value and an iterator, the result must denote an element in the same <code>vector</code> (or <code>string</code>) or denote one past the end of the associated <code>vector</code> (or <code>string</code>). As an example, we can compute an iterator to the element nearest the middle of a <code>vector</code>:</p>

```c++
// compute an iterator to the element closest to the midpoint of vi
auto mid = vi.begin() + vi.size() / 2;
```

<p>If <code>vi</code> has 20 elements, then <code>vi.size()/2</code> is <code>10</code>. In this case, we’d set <code>mid</code> equal to <code>vi.begin() + 10</code>. Remembering that subscripts start at 0, this element is the same as <code>vi[10]</code>, the element ten past the first.</p>
<p>In addition to comparing two iterators for equality, we can compare <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> iterators using the relational operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>). The iterators must be valid and must denote elements in (or one past the end of) the same <code>vector</code> or <code>string</code>. For example, assuming <code>it</code> is an iterator into the same <code>vector</code> as <code>mid</code>, we can check whether <code>it</code> denotes an element before or after <code>mid</code> as follows:</p>

```c++
if (it < mid)
    // process elements in the first half of vi
```

<p><a id="filepos844872"></a>We can also subtract two iterators so long as they refer to elements in, or one off the end of, the same <code>vector</code> or <code>string</code>. The result is the distance between the iterators. By distance we mean the amount by which we’d have to change one iterator to get the other. The result type is a signed integral type named <code>difference_type</code>. Both <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> define <code>difference_type</code>. This type is signed, because subtraction might have a negative result.</p>
<h5>Using Iterator Arithmetic</h5>
<p>A classic algorithm that uses iterator arithmetic is binary search. A binary search looks for a particular value in a sorted sequence. It operates by looking at the element closest to the middle of the sequence. If that element is the one we want, we’re done. Otherwise, if that element is smaller than the one we want, we continue our search by looking only at elements after the rejected one. If the middle element is larger than the one we want, we continue by looking only in the first half. We compute a new middle element in the reduced range and continue looking until we either find the element or run out of elements.</p>
<p>We can do a binary search using iterators as follows:</p>

```c++
// text must be sorted
// beg and end will denote the range we're searching
auto beg = text.begin(), end = text.end();
auto mid = text.begin() + (end - beg)/2; // original midpoint
// while there are still elements to look at and we haven't yet found sought
while (mid != end && *mid != sought) {
    if (sought < *mid)     // is the element we want in the first half?
        end = mid;         // if so, adjust the range to ignore the second half
    else                   // the element we want is in the second half
        beg = mid + 1;     // start looking with the element just after mid
    mid = beg + (end - beg)/2;  // new midpoint
}
```

<p>We start by defining three iterators: <code>beg</code> will be the first element in the range, <code>end</code> one past the last element, and <code>mid</code> the element closest to the middle. We initialize these iterators to denote the entire range in a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> named <code>text</code>.</p>
<p>Our loop first checks that the range is not empty. If <code>mid</code> is equal to the current value of <code>end</code>, then we’ve run out of elements to search. In this case, the condition fails and we exit the <code>while</code>. Otherwise, <code>mid</code> refers to an element and we check whether <code>mid</code> denotes the one we want. If so, we’re done and we exit the loop.</p>
<p>If we still have elements to process, the code inside the <code>while</code> adjusts the range by moving <code>end</code> or <code>beg</code>. If the element denoted by <code>mid</code> is greater than <code>sought</code>, we know that if <code>sought</code> is in <code>text</code>, it will appear before the element denoted by <code>mid</code>. Therefore, we can ignore elements after <code>mid</code>, which we do by assigning <code>mid</code> to <code>end</code>. If <code>*mid</code> is smaller than <code>sought</code>, the element must be in the range of elements after the one denoted by <code>mid</code>. In this case, we adjust the range by making <code>beg</code> denote the element just after <code>mid</code>. We already know that <code>mid</code> is not the one we want, so we can eliminate it from the range.</p>
<p>At the end of the <code>while</code>, <code>mid</code> will be equal to <code>end</code> or it will denote the element for which we are looking. If <code>mid</code> equals <code>end</code>, then the element was not in <code>text</code>.</p>

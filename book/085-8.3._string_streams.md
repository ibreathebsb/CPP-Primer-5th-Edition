<p>The <code>sstream</code> header defines three types to support in-memory IO; these types read from or write to a <code>string</code> as if the <code>string</code> were an IO stream.</p>
<p>The <code>istringstream</code> type reads a <code>string</code>, <code>ostringstream</code> writes a <code>string</code>, and <code>stringstream</code> reads and writes the <code>string</code>. Like the <code>fstream</code> types, the types defined in <code>sstream</code> inherit from the types we have used from the <code>iostream</code> header. In addition to the operations they inherit, the types defined in <code>sstream</code> add members to manage the <code>string</code> associated with the stream. These operations are listed in <a href="085-8.3._string_streams.html#filepos2146187">Table 8.5</a>. They may be called on <code>stringstream</code> objects but not on the other IO types.</p>

| Code               | Description                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sstream strm;`    | `strm` is an unbound `stringstream`. `sstream` is one of the types defined in the `sstream` header.             |
| `sstream strm(s);` | `strm` is an `sstream` that holds a copy of the `string` `s`. This constructor is `explicit` (§ 7.5.4, p. 296). |
| `strm.str()`       | Returns a copy of the `string` that `strm` holds.                                                               |
| `strm.str(s)`      | Copies the `string` `s` into `strm`. Returns `void`.                                                            |

<p>Note that although <code>fstream</code> and <code>sstream</code> share the interface to <code>iostream</code>, they have no other interrelationship. In particular, we cannot use <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> on a <code>stringstream</code>, nor can we use <code>str</code> on an <code>fstream</code>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos2147258">8.3.1. Using an <code>istringstream</code></h4>
<p>An <code>istringstream</code> is often used when we have some work to do on an entire line, and other work to do with individual words within a line.</p>
<p>As one example, assume we have a file that lists people and their associated phone numbers. Some people have only one number, but others have several—a home phone, work phone, cell number, and so on. Our input file might look like the following:</p>

```
morgan 2015552368 8625550123
drew 9735550130
lee 6095550132 2015550175 8005550000
```

<p>Each record in this file starts with a name, which is followed by one or more phone numbers. We’ll start by defining a simple class to represent our input data:</p>

```c++
// members are public by default; see § 7.2 (p. 268)
struct PersonInfo {
    string name;
    vector<string> phones;
};
```

<p>Objects of type <code>PersonInfo</code> will have one member that represents the person’s name and a <code>vector</code> holding a varying number of associated phone numbers.</p>
<p>Our program will read the data file and build up a <code>vector</code> of <code>PersonInfo</code>. Each element in the <code>vector</code> will correspond to one record in the file. We’ll process the input in a loop that reads a record and then extracts the name and phone numbers for each person:</p>

```c++
string line, word;  // will hold a line and word from input, respectively
vector<PersonInfo> people; // will hold all the records from the input
// read the input a line at a time until cin hits end-of-file (or another error)
while (getline(cin, line)) {
    PersonInfo info;      // create an object to hold this record's data
    istringstream record(line); // bind record to the line we just read
    record >> info.name;  // read the name
    while (record >> word)        // read the phone numbers
        info.phones.push_back(word);  // and store them
    people.push_back(info); // append this record to people
}
```

<p>Here we use <code>getline</code> to read an entire record from the standard input. If the call to <code>getline</code> succeeds, then <code>line</code> holds a record from the input file. Inside the <code>while</code> we define a local <code>PersonInfo</code> object to hold data from the current record.</p>
<p>Next we bind an <code>istringstream</code> to the line that we just read. We can now use the input operator on that <code>istringstream</code> to read each element in the current record. We first read the name followed by a <code>while</code> loop that will read the phone numbers for that person.</p>
<p>The inner <code>while</code> ends when we’ve read all the data in <code>line</code>. This loop works analogously to others we’ve written to read <code>cin</code>. The difference is that this loop reads data from a <code>string</code> rather than from the standard input. When the <code>string</code> has been completely read, “end-of-file” is signaled and the next input operation on <code>record</code> will fail.</p>
<p>We end the outer <code>while</code> loop by appending the <code>PersonInfo</code> we just processed to the <code>vector</code>. The outer <code>while</code> continues until we hit end-of-file on <code>cin</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 8.9:</strong> Use the function you wrote for the first exercise in § <a href="083-8.1._the_io_classes.html#filepos2085669">8.1.2</a> (p. <a href="083-8.1._the_io_classes.html#filepos2085669">314</a>) to print the contents of an <code>istringstream</code> object.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 8.10:</strong> Write a program to store each line from a file in a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>. Now use an <code>istringstream</code> to read each element from the <code>vector</code> a word at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 8.11:</strong> The program in this section defined its <code>istringstream</code> object inside the outer <code>while</code> loop. What changes would you need to make if <code>record</code> were defined outside that loop? Rewrite the program, moving the definition of <code>record</code> outside the <code>while</code>, and see whether you thought of all the changes that are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 8.12:</strong> Why didn’t we use in-class initializers in <code>PersonInfo</code>?</p>

<h4 id="filepos2157138"><a id="filepos2157171"></a>8.3.2. Using <code>ostringstream</code>s</h4>
<p>An <code>ostringstream</code> is useful when we need to build up our output a little at a time but do not want to print the output until later. For example, we might want to validate and reformat the phone numbers we read in the previous example. If all the numbers are valid, we want to print a new file containing the reformatted numbers. If a person has any invalid numbers, we won’t put them in the new file. Instead, we’ll write an error message containing the person’s name and a list of their invalid numbers.</p>
<p>Because we don’t want to include any data for a person with an invalid number, we can’t produce the output until we’ve seen and validated all their numbers. We can, however, “write” the output to an in-memory <code>ostringstream</code>:</p>

```c++
for (const auto &entry : people) {    // for each entry in people
    ostringstream formatted, badNums; // objects created on each loop
    for (const auto &nums : entry.phones) { // for each number
        if (!valid(nums)) {
            badNums << " " << nums;  // string in badNums
        } else
            // ''writes'' to formatted's string
            formatted << " " << format(nums);
    }
    if (badNums.str().empty())      // there were no bad numbers
        os << entry.name << " "     // print the name
           << formatted.str() << endl; // and reformatted numbers
    else                   // otherwise, print the name and bad numbers
        cerr << "input error: " << entry.name
             << " invalid number(s) " << badNums.str() << endl;
}
```

<p>In this program, we’ve assumed two functions, <code>valid</code> and <code>format</code>, that validate and reformat phone numbers, respectively. The interesting part of the program is the use of the string streams <code>formatted</code> and <code>badNums</code>. We use the normal output operator (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>) to write to these objects. But, these “writes” are really <code>string</code> manipulations. They add characters to the <code>string</code>s inside <code>formatted</code> and <code>badNums</code>, respectively.</p>

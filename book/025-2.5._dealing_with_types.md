<h3 id="filepos535463">2.5. Dealing with Types</h3>
<p>As our programs get more complicated, we’ll see that the types we use also get more complicated. Complications in using types arise in two different ways. Some types are hard to “spell.” That is, they have forms that are tedious and error-prone to write. Moreover, the form of a complicated type can obscure its purpose or meaning. The other source of complication is that sometimes it is hard to determine the exact type we need. Doing so can require us to look back into the context of the program.</p>
<h4 id="filepos536134">2.5.1. Type Aliases</h4>
<p>A <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos628113" id="filepos536265">type alias</a></strong> is a name that is a synonym for another type. Type aliases let us simplify complicated type definitions, making those types easier to use. Type aliases also let us emphasize the purpose for which a type is used.</p>
<p>We can define a type alias in one of two ways. Traditionally, we use a <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos628979" id="filepos536684">typedef</a></strong>:</p>

```c++
typedef double wages;   // wages is a synonym for double
typedef wages base, *p; // base is a synonym for double, p for double*
```

<p><a id="filepos537903"></a>The keyword <code>typedef</code> may appear as part of the base type of a declaration (§ <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos394806">2.3</a>, p. <a href="023-2.3._compound_types.html#filepos394806">50</a>). Declarations that include <code>typedef</code> define type aliases rather than variables. As in any other declaration, the declarators can include type modifiers that define compound types built from the base type of the definition.</p>
<a id="filepos538451"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>The new standard introduced a second way to define a type alias, via an <strong><a href="028-defined_terms.html#filepos611960" id="filepos538618">alias declaration</a></strong>:</p>

```c++
using SI = Sales_item;  // SI is a synonym for Sales_item
```

<p>An alias declaration starts with the keyword <code>using</code> followed by the alias name and an <code>=</code>. The alias declaration defines the name on the left-hand side of the <code>=</code> as an alias for the type that appears on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>A type alias is a type name and can appear wherever a type name can appear:</p>

```c++
wages hourly, weekly;    // same as double hourly, weekly;
SI item;                 // same as Sales_item item
```

<h5>Pointers, <code>const</code>, and Type Aliases</h5>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>Declarations that use type aliases that represent compound types and <code>const</code> can yield surprising results. For example, the following declarations use the type <code>pstring</code>, which is an alias for the the type <code>char*</code>:</p>

```c++
typedef char *pstring;
const pstring cstr = 0; // cstr is a constant pointer to char
const pstring *ps;      // ps is a pointer to a constant pointer to char
```

<p>The base type in these declarations is <code>const pstring</code>. As usual, a <code>const</code> that appears in the base type modifies the given type. The type of <code>pstring</code> is “pointer to <code>char</code>.” So, <code>const pstring</code> is a constant pointer to <code>char</code>—not a pointer to <code>const char</code>.</p>
<p>It can be tempting, albeit incorrect, to interpret a declaration that uses a type alias by conceptually replacing the alias with its corresponding type:</p>

```c++
const char *cstr = 0; // wrong interpretation of const pstring cstr
```

<p>However, this interpretation is wrong. When we use <code>pstring</code> in a declaration, the base type of the declaration is a pointer type. When we rewrite the declaration using <code>char*</code>, the base type is <code>char</code> and the <code>*</code> is part of the declarator. In this case, <code>const char</code> is the base type. This rewrite declares <code>cstr</code> as a pointer to <code>const char</code> rather than as a <code>const</code> pointer to <code>char</code>.</p>
<h4 id="filepos544751">2.5.2. The <code>auto</code> Type Specifier</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<a id="filepos545053"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>It is not uncommon to want to store the value of an expression in a variable. To declare the variable, we have to know the type of that expression. When we write a program, it can be surprisingly difficult—and sometimes even impossible—to determine the type of an expression. Under the new standard, we can let the compiler figure out the type for us by using the <code>auto</code> type specifier. Unlike type specifiers, such as <code>double</code>, that name a specific type, <code>auto</code> tells the compiler to deduce <a id="filepos545937"></a>the type from the initializer. By implication, a variable that uses <code>auto</code> as its type specifier must have an initializer:</p>

```c++
// the type of item is deduced from the type of the result of adding val1 and val2
auto item = val1 + val2; // item initialized to the result of val1 + val2
```

<p>Here the compiler will deduce the type of <code>item</code> from the type returned by applying <code>+</code> to <code>val1</code> and <code>val2</code>. If <code>val1</code> and <code>val2</code> are <code>Sales_item</code> objects (§ <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos219539">1.5</a>, p. <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos219539">19</a>), <code>item</code> will have type <code>Sales_item</code>. If those variables are type <code>double</code>, then <code>item</code> has type <code>double</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>As with any other type specifier, we can define multiple variables using <code>auto</code>. Because a declaration can involve only a single base type, the initializers for all the variables in the declaration must have types that are consistent with each other:</p>

```c++
auto i = 0, *p = &i;      // ok: i is int and p is a pointer to int
auto sz = 0, pi = 3.14;   // error: inconsistent types for sz and pi
```

<h5>Compound Types, <code>const</code>, and <code>auto</code></h5>
<p>The type that the compiler infers for <code>auto</code> is not always exactly the same as the initializer’s type. Instead, the compiler adjusts the type to conform to normal initialization rules.</p>
<p>First, as we’ve seen, when we use a reference, we are really using the object to which the reference refers. In particular, when we use a reference as an initializer, the initializer is the corresponding object. The compiler uses that object’s type for <code>auto</code>’s type deduction:</p>

```c++
int i = 0, &r = i;
auto a = r;  // a is an int (r is an alias for i, which has type int)
```

<p>Second, <code>auto</code> ordinarily ignores top-level <code>const</code>s (§ <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos504024">2.4.3</a>, p. <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos504024">63</a>). As usual in initializations, low-level <code>const</code>s, such as when an initializer is a pointer to <code>const</code>, are kept:</p>

```c++
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci;  // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr;  // c is an int (cr is an alias for ci whose const is top-level)
auto d = &i;  // d is an int*(& of an int object is int*)
auto e = &ci; // e is const int*(& of a const object is low-level const)
```

<p>If we want the deduced type to have a top-level <code>const</code>, we must say so explicitly:</p>

```c++
const auto f = ci; // deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int
```

<p>We can also specify that we want a reference to the <code>auto</code>-deduced type. Normal initialization rules still apply:</p>

```c++
auto &g = ci;       // g is a const int& that is bound to ci
auto &h = 42;       // error: we can't bind a plain reference to a literal
const auto &j = 42; // ok: we can bind a const reference to a literal
```

<p><a id="filepos558223"></a>When we ask for a reference to an <code>auto</code>-deduced type, top-level <code>const</code>s in the initializer are not ignored. As usual, <code>const</code>s are not top-level when we bind a reference to an initializer.</p>
<p>When we define several variables in the same statement, it is important to remember that a reference or pointer is part of a particular declarator and not part of the base type for the declaration. As usual, the initializers must provide consistent <code>auto</code>-deduced types:</p>

```c++
auto k = ci, &l = i;    // k is int; l is int&
auto &m = ci, *p = &ci; // m is a const int&;p is a pointer to const int
// error: type deduced from i is int; type deduced from &ci is const int
auto &n = i, *p2 = &ci;
```

<h4 id="filepos562878">2.5.3. The <code>decltype</code> Type Specifier</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Sometimes we want to define a variable with a type that the compiler deduces from an expression but do not want to use that expression to initialize the variable. For such cases, the new standard introduced a second type specifier, <code>decltype</code>, which returns the type of its operand. The compiler analyzes the expression to determine its type but does not evaluate the expression:</p>
<a id="filepos563798"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>

```c++
decltype(f()) sum = x; // sum has whatever type f returns
```

<p>Here, the compiler does not call <code>f</code>, but it uses the type that such a call would return as the type for <code>sum</code>. That is, the compiler gives <code>sum</code> the same type as the type that would be returned if we were to call <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>The way <code>decltype</code> handles top-level <code>const</code> and references differs subtly from the way <code>auto</code> does. When the expression to which we apply <code>decltype</code> is a variable, <a id="filepos565428"></a><code>decltype</code> returns the type of that variable, including top-level <code>const</code> and references:</p>

```c++
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;
decltype(ci) x = 0; // x has type const int
decltype(cj) y = x; // y has type const int& and is bound to x
decltype(cj) z;     // error: z is a reference and must be initialized
```

<p>Because <code>cj</code> is a reference, <code>decltype(cj)</code> is a reference type. Like any other reference, <code>z</code> must be initialized.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that <code>decltype</code> is the <em>only</em> context in which a variable defined as a reference is not treated as a synonym for the object to which it refers.</p>
<h5><code>decltype</code> and References</h5>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00010.jpg"/>
<p>When we apply <code>decltype</code> to an expression that is not a variable, we get the type that that expression yields. As we’ll see in § <a href="039-4.1._fundamentals.html#filepos999677">4.1.1</a> (p. <a href="039-4.1._fundamentals.html#filepos999677">135</a>), some expressions will cause <code>decltype</code> to yield a reference type. Generally speaking, <code>decltype</code> returns a reference type for expressions that yield objects that can stand on the left-hand side of the assignment:</p>

```c++
// decltype of an expression can be a reference type
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
decltype(r + 0) b;  // ok: addition yields an int; b is an (uninitialized) int
decltype(*p) c;     // error: c is int& and must be initialized
```

<p>Here <code>r</code> is a reference, so <code>decltype(r)</code> is a reference type. If we want the type to which <code>r</code> refers, we can use <code>r</code> in an expression, such as <code>r + 0</code>, which is an expression that yields a value that has a nonreference type.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the dereference operator is an example of an expression for which <code>decltype</code> returns a reference. As we’ve seen, when we dereference a pointer, we get the object to which the pointer points. Moreover, we can assign to that object. Thus, the type deduced by <code>decltype(*p)</code> is <code>int&amp;</code>, not plain <code>int</code>.</p>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>Another important difference between <code>decltype</code> and <code>auto</code> is that the deduction done by <code>decltype</code>
<em>depends on the form of its given expression</em>. What can be confusing is that enclosing the name of a variable in parentheses affects the type returned by <code>decltype</code>. When we apply <code>decltype</code> to a variable without any parentheses, we get the type of that variable. If we wrap the variable’s name in one or more sets of parentheses, the compiler will evaluate the operand as an expression. A variable is an expression that can be the left-hand side of an assignment. As a result, <code>decltype</code> on such an expression yields a reference:</p>

```c++
// decltype of a parenthesized variable is always a reference
decltype((i)) d;    // error: d is int& and must be initialized
decltype(i) e;      // ok: e is an (uninitialized) int
```

::: warning
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Remember that <code>decltype((</code><em>variable</em><code>))</code> (note, double parentheses) is always a reference type, but <code>decltype(</code><em>variable</em><code>)</code> is a reference type only if <em>variable</em> is a reference.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 2.37:</strong> Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand.

<h3 id="filepos3973987"><a id="filepos3974020"></a>15.7. Constructors and Copy Control</h3>
<p>Like any other class, a class in an inheritance hierarchy controls what happens when objects of its type are created, copied, moved, assigned, or destroyed. As for any other class, if a class (base or derived) does not itself define one of the copy-control operations, the compiler will synthesize that operation. Also, as usual, the synthesized version of any of these members might be a deleted function.</p>
<h4 id="filepos3974566">15.7.1. Virtual Destructors</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>The primary direct impact that inheritance has on copy control for a base class is that a base class generally should define a virtual destructor (§<a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3796139">15.2.1</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3796139">594</a>). The destructor needs to be virtual to allow objects in the inheritance hierarchy to be dynamically allocated.</p>
<p>Recall that the destructor is run when we <code>delete</code> a pointer to a dynamically allocated object (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3230370">13.1.3</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3230370">502</a>). If that pointer points to a type in an inheritance hierarchy, it is possible that the static type of the pointer might differ from the dynamic type of the object being destroyed (§<a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a>, p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">597</a>). For example, if we <code>delete</code> a pointer of type <code>Quote*</code>, that pointer might point at a <code>Bulk_quote</code> object. If the pointer points at a <code>Bulk_quote</code>, the compiler has to know that it should run the <code>Bulk_quote</code> destructor. As with any other function, we arrange to run the proper destructor by defining the destructor as virtual in the base class:</p>

```c++
class Quote {
public:
    // virtual destructor needed if a base pointer pointing to a derived object is deleted
    virtual ~Quote() = default; // dynamic binding for the destructor
};
```

<p>Like any other virtual, the virtual nature of the destructor is inherited. Thus, classes derived from <code>Quote</code> have virtual destructors, whether they use the synthesized destructor or define their own version. So long as the base class destructor is virtual, when we <code>delete</code> a pointer to base, the correct destructor will be run:</p>

```c++
Quote *itemP = new Quote;   //  same static and dynamic type
delete itemP;               //  destructor for Quote called
itemP = new Bulk_quote;     //  static and dynamic types differ
delete itemP;               //  destructor for Bulk_quote called
```

::: warning
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Executing <code>delete</code> on a pointer to base that points to a derived object has undefined behavior if the base’s destructor is not virtual.</p>
:::

<p>Destructors for base classes are an important exception to the rule of thumb that if a class needs a destructor, it also needs copy and assignment (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3244603">13.1.4</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3244603">504</a>). A base class almost always needs a destructor, so that it can make the destructor virtual. If a base class has an empty destructor in order to make it virtual, then the fact that the class has a destructor does not indicate that the assignment operator or copy constructor is also needed.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos3979938"></a>Virtual Destructors Turn Off Synthesized Move</h5>
<p>The fact that a base class needs a virtual destructor has an important indirect impact on the definition of base and derived classes: If a class defines a destructor—even if it uses <code>= default</code> to use the synthesized version—the compiler will not synthesize a move operation for that class (§<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">537</a>).</p>

:::

<h4 id="filepos3980968">15.7.2. Synthesized Copy Control and Inheritance</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>The synthesized copy-control members in a base or a derived class execute like any other synthesized constructor, assignment operator, or destructor: They memberwise initialize, assign, or destroy the members of the class itself. In addition, these synthesized members initialize, assign, or destroy the direct base part of an object by using the corresponding operation from the base class. For example,</p>
<ul><li>The synthesized <code>Bulk_quote</code> default constructor runs the <code>Disc_Quote</code> default constructor, which in turn runs the <code>Quote</code> default constructor.</li><li>The <code>Quote</code> default constructor default initializes the <code>bookNo</code> member to the empty string and uses the in-class initializer to initialize <code>price</code> to zero.</li><li>When the <code>Quote</code> constructor finishes, the <code>Disc_Quote</code> constructor continues, which uses the in-class initializers to initialize <code>qty</code> and <code>discount</code>.</li><li>When the <code>Disc_quote</code> constructor finishes, the <code>Bulk_quote</code> constructor continues but has no other work to do.</li></ul>

<p>Similarly, the synthesized <code>Bulk_quote</code> copy constructor uses the (synthesized) <code>Disc_quote</code> copy constructor, which uses the (synthesized) <code>Quote</code> copy constructor. The <code>Quote</code> copy constructor copies the <code>bookNo</code> and <code>price</code> members; and the <code>Disc_Quote</code> copy constructor copies the <code>qty</code> and <code>discount</code> members.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that it doesn’t matter whether the base-class member is itself synthesized (as is the case in our <code>Quote</code> hierarchy) or has a an user-provided definition. All that matters is that the corresponding member is accessible (§<a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a>, p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">611</a>) and that it is not a deleted function.</p>
<p>Each of our <code>Quote</code> classes use the synthesized destructor. The derived classes do so implicitly, whereas the <code>Quote</code> class does so explicitly by defining its (virtual) destructor as <code>= default</code>. The synthesized destructor is (as usual) empty and its implicit destruction part destroys the members of the class (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3230370">13.1.3</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3230370">501</a>). In addition to destroying its own members, the destruction phase of a destructor in a derived class also destroys its direct base. That destructor in turn invokes the destructor for its own direct base, if any. And, so on up to the root of the hierarchy.</p>
<p><a id="filepos3985641"></a>As we’ve seen, <code>Quote</code> does not have synthesized move operations because it defines a destructor. The (synthesized) copy operations will be used whenever we move a <code>Quote</code> object (§<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">540</a>). As we’re about to see, the fact that <code>Quote</code> does not have move operations means that its derived classes don’t either.</p>
<h5>Base Classes and Deleted Copy Control in the Derived</h5>
<a id="filepos3986390"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>The synthesized default constructor, or any of the copy-control members of either a base or a derived class, may be defined as deleted for the same reasons as in any other class (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3263004">13.1.6</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3263004">508</a>, and §<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">537</a>). In addition, the way in which a base class is defined can cause a derived-class member to be defined as deleted:</p>
<ul><li>If the default constructor, copy constructor, copy-assignment operator, or destructor in the base class is deleted or inaccessible (§<a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">15.5</a>, p. <a href="146-15.5._access_control_and_inheritance.html#filepos3901534">612</a>), then the corresponding member in the derived class is defined as deleted, because the compiler can’t use the base-class member to construct, assign, or destroy the base-class part of the object.</li><li>If the base class has an inaccessible or deleted destructor, then the synthesized default and copy constructors in the derived classes are defined as deleted, because there is no way to destroy the base part of the derived object.</li><li>As usual, the compiler will not synthesize a deleted move operation. If we use <code>= default</code> to request a move operation, it will be a deleted function in the derived if the corresponding operation in the base is deleted or inaccessible, because the base class part cannot be moved. The move constructor will also be deleted if the base class destructor is deleted or inaccessible.</li></ul>

<p>As an example, this base class, <code>B</code>,</p>

```c++
class B {
public:
    B();
    B(const B&) = delete;
    // other members, not including a move constructor
};
class D : public B {
    // no constructors
};
D d;     // ok: D's synthesized default constructor uses B's default constructor
D d2(d); // error: D's synthesized copy constructor is deleted
D d3(std::move(d)); // error: implicitly uses D's deleted copy constructor
```

<p>has an accessible default constructor and an explicitly deleted copy constructor. Because the copy constructor is defined, the compiler will not synthesize a move constructor for class <code>B</code> (§<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">537</a>). As a result, we can neither move nor copy objects of type <code>B</code>. If a class derived from <code>B</code> wanted to allow its objects to be copied or moved, that derived class would have to define its own versions of these constructors. Of course, that class would have to decide how to copy or move the members in it base-class part. In practice, if a base class does not have a default, copy, or move constructor, then its derived classes usually don’t either.</p>
<h5>Move Operations and Inheritance</h5>
<p>As we’ve seen, most base classes define a virtual destructor. As a result, by default, base classes generally do not get synthesized move operations. Moreover, by default, classes derived from a base class that doesn’t have move operations don’t get synthesized move operations either.</p>
<p>Because lack of a move operation in a base class suppresses synthesized move for its derived classes, base classes ordinarily should define the move operations if it is sensible to do so. Our <code>Quote</code> class can use the synthesized versions. However, <code>Quote</code> must define these members explicitly. Once it defines its move operations, it must also explicitly define the copy versions as well (§<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">539</a>):</p>

```c++
class Quote {
public:
    Quote() = default;             // memberwise default initialize
    Quote(const Quote&) = default; // memberwise copy
    Quote(Quote&&) = default;      // memberwise copy
    Quote& operator=(const Quote&) = default; // copy assign
    Quote& operator=(Quote&&) = default;      // move assign
    virtual ~Quote() = default;
    // other members as before
};
```

<p>Now, <code>Quote</code> objects will be memberwise copied, moved, assigned, and destroyed. Moreover, classes derived from <code>Quote</code> will automatically obtain synthesized move operations as well, unless they have members that otherwise preclude move.</p>

<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>As we saw in §<a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">15.2.2</a> (p. <a href="143-15.2._defining_base_and_derived_classes.html#filepos3806030">598</a>), the initialization phase of a derived-class constructor initializes the base-class part(s) of a derived object as well as initializing its own members.

<h5>Defining a Derived Copy or Move Constructor</h5>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>When we define a copy or move constructor (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3203084">13.1.1</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3203084">496</a>, and §<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">534</a>) for a derived class, we ordinarily use the corresponding base-class constructor to initialize the base part of the object:</p>

```c++
class Base { /* ...    */ } ;
class D: public Base {
public:
    // by default, the base class default constructor initializes the base part of an object
    // to use the copy or move constructor, we must explicitly call that
    // constructor in the constructor initializer list
    D(const D& d): Base(d)      // copy the base members
                 /* initializers for members of D */ { /* ...  */ }
    D(D&& d): Base(std::move(d)) // move the base members
                 /* initializers for members of D */ { /* ...  */ }
};
```

<p>The initializer <code>Base(d)</code> passes a <code>D</code> object to a base-class constructor. Although in principle, <code>Base</code> could have a constructor that has a parameter of type <code>D</code>, in practice, that is very unlikely. Instead, <code>Base(d)</code> will (ordinarily) match the <code>Base</code> copy constructor. The <code>D</code> object, <code>d</code>, will be bound to the <code>Base&amp;</code> parameter in that constructor. The <code>Base</code> copy constructor will copy the base part of <code>d</code> into the object that is being created. Had the initializer for the base class been omitted,</p>

```c++
// probably incorrect definition of the D copy constructor
// base-class part is default initialized, not copied
D(const D& d) /* member initializers, but no base-class initializer    */
    { /* ...   */ }
```

<p>the <code>Base</code> default constructor would be used to initialize the base part of a <code>D</code> object. Assuming <code>D</code>’s constructor copies the derived members from <code>d</code>, this newly constructed object would be oddly configured: Its <code>Base</code> members would hold default values, while its <code>D</code> members would be copies of the data from another object.</p>

::: warning
<p>Warning</p>
<p>By default, the base-class default constructor initializes the base-class part of a derived object. If we want copy (or move) the base-class part, we must explicitly use the copy (or move) constructor for the base class in the derived’s constructor initializer list.</p>
:::

<h5>Derived-Class Assignment Operator</h5>
<p>Like the copy and move constructors, a derived-class assignment operator (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">13.1.2</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">500</a>, and §<a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">536</a>), must assign its base part explicitly:</p>
<p><a id="filepos4002835"></a></p>

```c++
// Base::operator=(const Base&) is not invoked automatically
D &D::operator=(const D &rhs)
{
    Base::operator=(rhs); // assigns the base part
    // assign the members in the derived class, as usual,
    // handling self-assignment and freeing existing resources as appropriate
    return *this;
}
```

<p>This operator starts by explicitly calling the base-class assignment operator to assign the members of the base part of the derived object. The base-class operator will (presumably) correctly handle self-assignment and, if appropriate, will free the old value in the base part of the left-hand operand and assign the new values from <code>rhs</code>. Once that operator finishes, we continue doing whatever is needed to assign the members in the derived class.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that a derived constructor or assignment operator can use its corresponding base class operation regardless of whether the base defined its own version of that operator or uses the synthesized version. For example, the call to <code>Base::operator=</code> executes the copy-assignment operator in class <code>Base</code>. It is immaterial whether that operator is defined explicitly by the <code>Base</code> class or is synthesized by the compiler.</p>
<h5>Derived-Class Destructor</h5>
<p>Recall that the data members of an object are implicitly destroyed after the destructor body completes (§<a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3230370">13.1.3</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3230370">502</a>). Similarly, the base-class parts of an object are also implicitly destroyed. As a result, unlike the constructors and assignment operators, a derived destructor is responsible only for destroying the resources allocated by the derived class:</p>

```c++
class D: public Base {
public:
    // Base::~Base invoked automatically
    ~D() { /* do what it takes to clean up derived members   */ }
};
```

<p>Objects are destroyed in the opposite order from which they are constructed: The derived destructor is run first, and then the base-class destructors are invoked, back up through the inheritance hierarchy.</p>
<h5>Calls to Virtuals in Constructors and Destructors</h5>
<p>As we’ve seen, the base-class part of a derived object is constructed first. While the base-class constructor is executing, the derived part of the object is uninitialized. Similarly, derived objects are destroyed in reverse order, so that when a base class destructor runs, the derived part has already been destroyed. As a result, while these base-class members are executing, the object is incomplete.</p>
<p>To accommodate this incompleteness, the compiler treats the object as if its type changes during construction or destruction. That is, while an object is being constructed it is treated as if it has the same class as the constructor; calls to virtual <a id="filepos4007500"></a>functions will be bound as if the object has the same type as the constructor itself. Similarly, for destructors. This binding applies to virtuals called directly or that are called indirectly from a function that the constructor (or destructor) calls.</p>
<p>To understand this behavior, consider what would happen if the derived-class version of a virtual was called from a base-class constructor. This virtual probably accesses members of the derived object. After all, if the virtual didn’t need to use members of the derived object, the derived class probably could use the version in its base class. However, those members are uninitialized while a base constructor is running. If such access were allowed, the program would probably crash.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>If a constructor or destructor calls a virtual, the version that is run is the one corresponding to the type of the constructor or destructor itself.</p>

<h4 id="filepos4009689">15.7.4. Inherited Constructors</h4>
<a id="filepos4009802"></a><img alt="Image" src="/images/00008.jpg"/>
<p>Under the new standard, a derived class can reuse the constructors defined by its direct base class. Although, as we’ll see, such constructors are not inherited in the normal sense of that term, it is nonetheless common to refer to such constructors as “inherited.” For the same reasons that a class may initialize only its direct base class, a class may inherit constructors only from its direct base. A class cannot inherit the default, copy, and move constructors. If the derived class does not directly define these constructors, the compiler synthesizes them as usual.</p>
<p>A derived class inherits its base-class constructors by providing a <code>using</code> declaration that names its (direct) base class. As an example, we can redefine our <code>Bulk_quote</code> class (§<a href="145-15.4._abstract_base_classes.html#filepos3884701">15.4</a>, p. <a href="145-15.4._abstract_base_classes.html#filepos3884701">610</a>) to inherit its constructors from <code>Disc_quote</code>:</p>

```c++
class Bulk_quote : public Disc_quote {
public:
    using Disc_quote::Disc_quote; // inherit Disc_quote's constructors
    double net_price(std::size_t) const;
};
```

<p>Ordinarily, a <code>using</code> declaration only makes a name visible in the current scope. When applied to a constructor, a <code>using</code> declaration causes the compiler to generate code. The compiler generates a derived constructor corresponding to each constructor in the base. That is, for each constructor in the base class, the compiler generates a constructor in the derived class that has the same parameter list.</p>
<p><a id="filepos4012384"></a>These compiler-generated constructors have the form</p>

```c++
derived(parms) : base(args) { }
```

<p>where <em>derived</em> is the name of the derived class, <em>base</em> is the name of the base class, <em>parms</em> is the parameter list of the constructor, and <em>args</em> pass the parameters from the derived constructor to the base constructor. In our <code>Bulk_quote</code> class, the inherited constructor would be equivalent to</p>

```c++
Bulk_quote(const std::string& book, double price,
          std::size_t qty, double disc):
      Disc_quote(book, price, qty, disc) { }
```

<p>If the derived class has any data members of its own, those members are default initialized (§<a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">7.1.4</a>, p. <a href="073-7.1._defining_abstract_data_types.html#filepos1802479">266</a>).</p>
<h5>Characteristics of an Inherited Constructor</h5>
<p>Unlike <code>using</code> declarations for ordinary members, a constructor <code>using</code> declaration does not change the access level of the inherited constructor(s). For example, regardless of where the <code>using</code> declaration appears, a <code>private</code> constructor in the base is a <code>private</code> constructor in the derived; similarly for <code>protected</code> and <code>public</code> constructors.</p>
<p>Moreover, a <code>using</code> declaration can’t specify <code>explicit</code> or <code>constexpr</code>. If a constructor in the base is <code>explicit</code> (§<a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1990205">7.5.4</a>, p. <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos1990205">296</a>) or <code>constexpr</code> (§<a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos2019288">7.5.6</a>, p. <a href="077-7.5._constructors_revisited.html#filepos2019288">299</a>), the inherited constructor has the same property.</p>
<p>If a base-class constructor has default arguments (§<a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1631032">6.5.1</a>, p. <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1631032">236</a>), those arguments are not inherited. Instead, the derived class gets multiple inherited constructors in which each parameter with a default argument is successively omitted. For example, if the base has a constructor with two parameters, the second of which has a default, the derived class will obtain two constructors: one with both parameters (and no default argument) and a second constructor with a single parameter corresponding to the left-most, non-defaulted parameter in the base class.</p>
<p>If a base class has several constructors, then with two exceptions, the derived class inherits each of the constructors from its base class. The first exception is that a derived class can inherit some constructors and define its own versions of other constructors. If the derived class defines a constructor with the same parameters as a constructor in the base, then that constructor is not inherited. The one defined in the derived class is used in place of the inherited constructor.</p>
<p>The second exception is that the default, copy, and move constructors are not inherited. These constructors are synthesized using the normal rules. An inherited constructor is not treated as a user-defined constructor. Therefore, a class that contains only inherited constructors will have a synthesized default constructor.</p>

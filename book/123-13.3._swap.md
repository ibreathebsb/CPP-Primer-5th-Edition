<h3 id="filepos3315883">13.3. Swap</h3>
<p>In addition to defining the copy-control members, classes that manage resources often also define a function named <code>swap</code> (§ <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2239281">9.2.5</a>, p. <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2239281">339</a>). Defining <code>swap</code> is particularly important for classes that we plan to use with algorithms that reorder elements (§ <a href="099-10.2._a_first_look_at_the_algorithms.html#filepos2506543">10.2.3</a>, p. <a href="099-10.2._a_first_look_at_the_algorithms.html#filepos2506543">383</a>). Such algorithms call <code>swap</code> whenever they need to exchange two elements.</p>
<p>If a class defines its own <code>swap</code>, then the algorithm uses that class-specific version. Otherwise, it uses the <code>swap</code> function defined by the library. Although, as usual, we don’t know how <code>swap</code> is implemented, conceptually it’s easy to see that swapping two objects involves a copy and two assignments. For example, code to swap two objects of our valuelike <code>HasPtr</code> class (§ <a href="122-13.2._copy_control_and_resource_management.html#filepos3285596">13.2.1</a>, p. <a href="122-13.2._copy_control_and_resource_management.html#filepos3285596">511</a>) might look something like:</p>

```c++
HasPtr temp = v1; // make a temporary copy of the value of v1
v1 = v2;          // assign the value of v2 to v1
v2 = temp;        // assign the saved value of v1 to v2
```

<p><a id="filepos3318720"></a>This code copies the <code>string</code> that was originally in <code>v1</code> twice—once when the <code>HasPtr</code> copy constructor copies <code>v1</code> into <code>temp</code> and again when the assignment operator assigns <code>temp</code> to <code>v2</code>. It also copies the <code>string</code> that was originally in <code>v2</code> when it assigns <code>v2</code> to <code>v1</code>. As we’ve seen, copying a valuelike <code>HasPtr</code> allocates a new <code>string</code> and copies the <code>string</code> to which the <code>HasPtr</code> points.</p>
<p>In principle, none of this memory allocation is necessary. Rather than allocating new copies of the <code>string</code>, we’d like <code>swap</code> to swap the pointers. That is, we’d like swapping two <code>HasPtr</code>s to execute as:</p>

```c++
string *temp = v1.ps; // make a temporary copy of the pointer in v1.ps
v1.ps = v2.ps;        // assign the pointer in v2.ps to v1.ps
v2.ps = temp;         // assign the saved pointer in v1.ps to v2.ps
```

<h4>Writing Our Own <code>swap</code> Function</h4>
<p>We can override the default behavior of <code>swap</code> by defining a version of <code>swap</code> that operates on our class. The typical implementation of <code>swap</code> is:</p>

```c++
class HasPtr {
    friend void swap(HasPtr&, HasPtr&);
    // other members as in § 13.2.1 (p. 511)
};
inline
void swap(HasPtr &lhs, HasPtr &rhs)
{
    using std::swap;
    swap(lhs.ps, rhs.ps); // swap the pointers, not the string data
    swap(lhs.i, rhs.i);   // swap the int members
}
```

<p>We start by declaring <code>swap</code> as a <code>friend</code> to give it access to <code>HasPtr</code>’s (<code>private</code>) data members. Because <code>swap</code> exists to optimize our code, we’ve defined <code>swap</code> as an <code>inline</code> function (§ <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">6.5.2</a>, p. <a href="067-6.5._features_for_specialized_uses.html#filepos1645920">238</a>). The body of <code>swap</code> calls <code>swap</code> on each of the data members of the given object. In this case, we first <code>swap</code> the pointers and then the <code>int</code> members of the objects bound to <code>rhs</code> and <code>lhs</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Note</p>
<p>Unlike the copy-control members, <code>swap</code> is never necessary. However, defining <code>swap</code> can be an important optimization for classes that allocate resources.</p>

<h4><code>swap</code> Functions Should Call <code>swap</code>, Not <code>std::swap</code></h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>There is one important subtlety in this code: Although it doesn’t matter in this particular case, it is essential that <code>swap</code> functions call <code>swap</code> and not <code>std::swap</code>. In the <code>HasPtr</code> function, the data members have built-in types. There is no type-specific version of <code>swap</code> for the built-in types. In this case, these calls will invoke the library <code>std::swap</code>.</p>
<p>However, if a class has a member that has its own type-specific <code>swap</code> function, calling <code>std::swap</code> would be a mistake. For example, assume we had another class named <code>Foo</code> that has a member named <code>h</code>, which has type <code>HasPtr</code>. If we did <a id="filepos3327477"></a>not write a <code>Foo</code> version of <code>swap</code>, then the library version of <code>swap</code> would be used. As we’ve already seen, the library <code>swap</code> makes unnecessary copies of the <code>string</code>s managed by <code>HasPtr</code>.</p>
<p>We can avoid these copies by writing a <code>swap</code> function for <code>Foo</code>. However, if we wrote the <code>Foo</code> version of <code>swap</code> as:</p>

```c++
void swap(Foo &lhs, Foo &rhs)
{
    // WRONG: this function uses the library version of swap, not the HasPtr version
    std::swap(lhs.h, rhs.h);
    // swap other members of type Foo
}
```

<p>this code would compile and execute. However, there would be no performance difference between this code and simply using the default version of <code>swap</code>. The problem is that we’ve explicitly requested the library version of <code>swap</code>. However, we don’t want the version in <code>std</code>; we want the one defined for <code>HasPtr</code> objects.</p>
<p>The right way to write this <code>swap</code> function is:</p>

```c++
void swap(Foo &lhs, Foo &rhs)
{
    using std::swap;
    swap(lhs.h, rhs.h); // uses the HasPtr version of swap
    // swap other members of type Foo
}
```

<p>Each call to <code>swap</code> must be unqualified. That is, each call should be to <code>swap</code>, not <code>std::swap</code>. For reasons we’ll explain in § <a href="156-16.3._overloading_and_templates.html#filepos4436613">16.3</a> (p. <a href="156-16.3._overloading_and_templates.html#filepos4436613">697</a>), if there is a type-specific version of <code>swap</code>, that version will be a better match than the one defined in <code>std</code>. As a result, if there is a type-specific version of <code>swap</code>, calls to <code>swap</code> will match that type-specific version. If there is no type-specific version, then—assuming there is a <code>using</code> declaration for <code>swap</code> in scope—calls to <code>swap</code> will use the version in <code>std</code>.</p>
<p>Very careful readers may wonder why the <code>using</code> declaration inside <code>swap</code> does not hide the declarations for the <code>HasPtr</code> version of <code>swap</code> (§ <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1621309">6.4.1</a>, p. <a href="066-6.4._overloaded_functions.html#filepos1621309">234</a>). We’ll explain the reasons for why this code works in § <a href="172-18.2._namespaces.html#filepos4989992">18.2.3</a> (p. <a href="172-18.2._namespaces.html#filepos4989992">798</a>).</p>
<h4>Using <code>swap</code> in Assignment Operators</h4>
<p>Classes that define <code>swap</code> often use <code>swap</code> to define their assignment operator. These operators use a technique known as <strong><a href="128-defined_terms.html#filepos3534923" id="filepos3333773">copy and swap</a></strong>. This technique <em>swaps</em> the left-hand operand with a <em>copy</em> of the right-hand operand:</p>

```c++
// note rhs is passed by value, which means the HasPtr copy constructor
// copies the string in the right-hand operand into rhs
HasPtr& HasPtr::operator=(HasPtr rhs)
{
    // swap the contents of the left-hand operand with the local variable rhs
    swap(*this, rhs); // rhs now points to the memory this object had used
    return *this;     // rhs is destroyed, which deletes the pointer in rhs
}
```

<p><a id="filepos3335986"></a>In this version of the assignment operator, the parameter is not a reference. Instead, we pass the right-hand operand by value. Thus, <code>rhs</code> is a copy of the right-hand operand. Copying a <code>HasPtr</code> allocates a new copy of that object’s <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>In the body of the assignment operator, we call <code>swap</code>, which swaps the data members of <code>rhs</code> with those in <code>*this</code>. This call puts the pointer that had been in the left-hand operand into <code>rhs</code>, and puts the pointer that was in <code>rhs</code> into <code>*this</code>. Thus, after the <code>swap</code>, the pointer member in <code>*this</code> points to the newly allocated <code>string</code> that is a copy of the right-hand operand.</p>
<p>When the assignment operator finishes, <code>rhs</code> is destroyed and the <code>HasPtr</code> destructor is run. That destructor <code>delete</code>s the memory to which <code>rhs</code> now points, thus freeing the memory to which the left-hand operand had pointed.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this technique is that it automatically handles self assignment and is automatically exception safe. By copying the right-hand operand before changing the left-hand operand, it handles self assignment in the same was as we did in our original assignment operator (§ <a href="122-13.2._copy_control_and_resource_management.html#filepos3285596">13.2.1</a>, p. <a href="122-13.2._copy_control_and_resource_management.html#filepos3285596">512</a>). It manages exception safety in the same way as the original definition as well. The only code that might throw is the <code>new</code> expression inside the copy constructor. If an exception occurs, it will happen before we have changed the left-hand operand.</p>

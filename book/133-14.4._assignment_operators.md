<h3 id="filepos3614210">14.4. Assignment Operators</h3>
<p>In addition to the copy- and move-assignment operators that assign one object of the class type to another object of the same type (§ <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">13.1.2</a>, p. <a href="121-13.1._copy_assign_and_destroy.html#filepos3222083">500</a>, and § <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">13.6.2</a>, p. <a href="126-13.6._moving_objects.html#filepos3443291">536</a>), a class can define additional assignment operators that allow other types as the right-hand operand.</p>
<p>As one example, in addition to the copy- and move-assignment operators, the library <code>vector</code> class defines a third assignment operator that takes a braced list of elements (§ <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2239281">9.2.5</a>, p. <a href="090-9.2._container_library_overview.html#filepos2239281">337</a>). We can use this operator as follows:</p>

```c++
vector<string> v;
v = {"a", "an", "the"};
```

<p>We can add this operator to our <code>StrVec</code> class (§ <a href="125-13.5._classes_that_manage_dynamic_memory.html#filepos3380687">13.5</a>, p. <a href="125-13.5._classes_that_manage_dynamic_memory.html#filepos3380687">526</a>) as well:</p>

```c++
class StrVec {
public:
    StrVec &operator=(std::initializer_list<std::string>);
    // other members as in § 13.5 (p. 526)
};
```

<p><a id="filepos3616357"></a>To be consistent with assignment for the built-in types (and with the copy- and move-assignment operators we already defined), our new assignment operator will return a reference to its left-hand operand:</p>

```c++
StrVec &StrVec::operator=(initializer_list<string> il)
{
    // alloc_n_copy allocates space and copies elements from the given range
    auto data = alloc_n_copy(il.begin(), il.end());
    free();   // destroy the elements in this object and free the space
    elements = data.first; // update data members to point to the new space
    first_free = cap = data.second;
    return *this;
}
```

<p>As with the copy- and move-assignment operators, other overloaded assignment operators have to free the existing elements and create new ones. Unlike the copy-and move-assignment operators, this operator does not need to check for self-assignment. The parameter is an <code>initializer_list&lt;string&gt;</code> (§ <a href="064-6.2._argument_passing.html#filepos1534679">6.2.6</a>, p. <a href="064-6.2._argument_passing.html#filepos1534679">220</a>), which means that <code>il</code> cannot be the same object as the one denoted by <code>this</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Assignment operators can be overloaded. Assignment operators, regardless of parameter type, must be defined as member functions.</p>
:::

<h4>Compound-Assignment Operators</h4>
<p>Compound assignment operators are not required to be members. However, we prefer to define all assignments, including compound assignments, in the class. For consistency with the built-in compound assignment, these operators should return a reference to their left-hand operand. For example, here is the definition of the <code>Sales_data</code> compound-assignment operator:</p>

```c++
// member binary operator: left-hand operand is bound to the implicit this pointer
// assumes that both objects refer to the same book
Sales_data& Sales_data::operator+=(const Sales_data &rhs)
{
    units_sold += rhs.units_sold;
    revenue += rhs.revenue;
    return *this;
}
```

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Assignment operators must, and ordinarily compound-assignment operators should, be defined as members. These operators should return a reference to the left-hand operand.</p>

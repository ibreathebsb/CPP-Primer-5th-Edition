<h3 id="filepos1368051">5.6. <code>try</code> Blocks and Exception Handling</h3>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00010.jpg"/>
<p>Exceptions are run-time anomalies—such as losing a database connection or encountering unexpected input—that exist outside the normal functioning of a program. Dealing with anomalous behavior can be one of the most difficult parts of designing any system.</p>
<p>Exception handling is generally used when one part of a program detects a problem that it cannot resolve and the problem is such that the detecting part of the program cannot continue. In such cases, the detecting part needs a way to signal that something happened and that it cannot continue. Moreover, the detecting part needs a way to signal the problem without knowing what part of the program will deal with the exceptional condition. Having signaled what happened, the detecting part stops processing.</p>
<p>A program that contains code that might raise an exception (usually) has another part to handle whatever happened. For example, if the problem is invalid input, the handling part might ask the user to provide correct input. If the database was lost, the handling part might alert an operator.</p>
<p>Exception handling supports this cooperation between the detecting and handling parts of a program. In C++, exception handling involves</p>
<ul><li><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1411033" id="filepos1369863"><code>throw</code>
<strong>expressions</strong></a>, which the detecting part uses to indicate that it encountered something it can’t handle. We say that a <code>throw</code>
<strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1409331" id="filepos1370258">raises</a></strong> an exception.</li><li><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1411534" id="filepos1370430"><code>try</code>
<strong>blocks</strong></a>, which the handling part uses to deal with an exception. A <code>try</code> block starts with the keyword <code>try</code> and ends with one or more <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1401925" id="filepos1370880"><code>catch</code>
<strong>clauses</strong></a>. Exceptions thrown from code executed inside a <code>try</code> block are usually handled by one of the <code>catch</code> clauses. Because they “handle” the exception, <code>catch</code> clauses are also known as <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1405959" id="filepos1371468">exception handlers</a></strong>.</li><li>A set of <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1405165" id="filepos1371648"><code>exception</code>
<strong>classes</strong></a> that are used to pass information about what happened between a <code>throw</code> and an associated <code>catch</code>.</li></ul>

<p>In the remainder of this section, we’ll introduce these three components of exception handling. We’ll also have more to say about exceptions in § <a href="171-18.1._exception_handling.html#filepos4855328">18.1</a> (p. <a href="171-18.1._exception_handling.html#filepos4855328">772</a>).</p>
<h4 id="filepos1372413">5.6.1. A <code>throw</code> Expression</h4>
<p>The detecting part of a program uses a <code>throw</code> expression to raise an exception. A <code>throw</code> consists of the keyword <code>throw</code> followed by an expression. The type of the expression determines what kind of exception is thrown. A <code>throw</code> expression is usually followed by a semicolon, making it into an expression statement.</p>
<p><a id="filepos1373296"></a>As a simple example, recall the program in § <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos237516">1.5.2</a> (p. <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos237516">23</a>) that added two objects of type <code>Sales_item</code>. That program checked whether the records it read referred to the same book. If not, it printed a message and exited.</p>

```c++
Sales_item item1, item2;
cin >> item1 >> item2;
// first check that item1 and item2 represent the same book
if (item1.isbn() == item2.isbn()) {
    cout << item1 + item2 << endl;
    return 0;   // indicate success
} else {
    cerr << "Data must refer to same ISBN"
              << endl;
    return -1;  // indicate failure
}
```

<p>In a more realistic program, the part that adds the objects might be separated from the part that manages the interaction with a user. In this case, we might rewrite the test to throw an exception rather than returning an error indicator:</p>

```c++
// first check that the data are for the same item
if (item1.isbn() != item2.isbn())
    throw runtime_error("Data must refer to same ISBN");
// if we're still here, the ISBNs are the same
cout << item1 + item2 << endl;
```

<p>In this code, if the <small>ISBN</small>s differ, we throw an expression that is an object of type <code>runtime_error</code>. Throwing an exception terminates the current function and transfers control to a handler that will know how to handle this error.</p>
<p>The type <code>runtime_error</code> is one of the standard library exception types and is defined in the <code>stdexcept</code> header. We’ll have more to say about these types in § <a href="059-5.6._try_blocks_and_exception_handling.html#filepos1391364">5.6.3</a> (p. <a href="059-5.6._try_blocks_and_exception_handling.html#filepos1391364">197</a>). We must initialize a <code>runtime_error</code> by giving it a <code>string</code> or a C-style character string (§ <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos918393">3.5.4</a>, p. <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos918393">122</a>). That string provides additional information about the problem.</p>
<h4 id="filepos1377241">5.6.2. The <code>try</code> Block</h4>
<p>The general form of a <code>try</code> block is</p>

```c++
try {
    program-statements
} catch (exception-declaration) {
    handler-statements
} catch (exception-declaration) {
    handler-statements
} // . . .
```

<p>A <code>try</code> block begins with the keyword <code>try</code> followed by a block, which, as usual, is a sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces.</p>
<p><a id="filepos1378878"></a>Following the <code>try</code> block is a list of one or more <code>catch</code> clauses. A <code>catch</code> consists of three parts: the keyword <code>catch</code>, the declaration of a (possibly unnamed) object within parentheses (referred to as an <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1405543" id="filepos1379347">exception declaration</a></strong>), and a block. When a <code>catch</code> is selected to handle an exception, the associated block is executed. Once the <code>catch</code> finishes, execution continues with the statement immediately following the last <code>catch</code> clause of the <code>try</code> block.</p>
<p>The <em>program-statements</em> inside the <code>try</code> constitute the normal logic of the program. Like any other blocks, they can contain any C++ statement, including declarations. As with any block, variables declared inside a <code>try</code> block are inaccessible outside the block—in particular, they are not accessible to the <code>catch</code> clauses.</p>
<h5>Writing a Handler</h5>
<p>In the preceding example, we used a <code>throw</code> to avoid adding two <code>Sales_item</code>s that represented different books. We imagined that the part of the program that added two <code>Sales_item</code>s was separate from the part that communicated with the user. The part that interacts with the user might contain code something like the following to handle the exception that was thrown:</p>

```c++
while (cin >> item1 >> item2) {
    try {
        // execute code that will add the two Sales_items
        // if the addition fails, the code throws a runtime_error exception
    } catch (runtime_error err) {
        // remind the user that the ISBNs must match and prompt for another pair
        cout << err.what()
             << "\nTry Again?  Enter y or n" << endl;
        char c;
        cin >> c;
        if (!cin || c == 'n')
            break;      // break out of the while loop
    }
}
```

<p>The ordinary logic of the program that manages the interaction with the user appears inside the <code>try</code> block. This part of the program is wrapped inside a <code>try</code> because it might throw an exception of type <code>runtime_error</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>try</code> block has a single <code>catch</code> clause, which handles exceptions of type <code>runtime_error</code>. The statements in the block following the <code>catch</code> are executed if code inside the <code>try</code> block throws a <code>runtime_error</code>. Our <code>catch</code> handles the error by printing a message and asking the user to indicate whether to continue. If the user enters ’<code>n</code>’, then the <code>break</code> is executed and we exit the <code>while</code>. Otherwise, execution falls through to the closing brace of the <code>while</code>, which transfers control back to the <code>while</code> condition for the next iteration.</p>
<p>The prompt to the user prints the return from <code>err.what()</code>. We know that <code>err</code> has type <code>runtime_error</code>, so we can infer that <code>what</code> is a member function (§ <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos237516">1.5.2</a>, p. <a href="015-1.5._introducing_classes.html#filepos237516">23</a>) of the <code>runtime_error</code> class. Each of the library exception classes defines a member function named <code>what</code>. These functions take no arguments and return a C-style character string (i.e., a <code>const char*</code>). The <code>what</code> member of <a id="filepos1386153"></a><code>runtime_error</code> returns a copy of the <code>string</code> used to initialize the particular object. If the code described in the previous section threw an exception, then this <code>catch</code> would print</p>

```
Data must refer to same ISBN
Try Again?  Enter y or n
```

<h5>Functions Are Exited during the Search for a Handler</h5>
<p>In complicated systems, the execution path of a program may pass through multiple <code>try</code> blocks before encountering code that throws an exception. For example, a <code>try</code> block might call a function that contains a <code>try</code>, which calls another function with its own <code>try</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The search for a handler reverses the call chain. When an exception is thrown, the function that threw the exception is searched first. If no matching <code>catch</code> is found, that function terminates. The function that called the one that threw is searched next. If no handler is found, that function also exits. That function’s caller is searched next, and so on back up the execution path until a <code>catch</code> of an appropriate type is found.</p>
<p>If no appropriate <code>catch</code> is found, execution is transferred to a library function named <code>terminate</code>. The behavior of that function is system dependent but is guaranteed to stop further execution of the program.</p>
<p>Exceptions that occur in programs that do not define any <code>try</code> blocks are handled in the same manner: After all, if there are no <code>try</code> blocks, there can be no handlers. If a program has no <code>try</code> blocks and an exception occurs, then <code>terminate</code> is called and the program is exited.</p>

<p>Caution: Writing Exception Safe Code is <em>Hard</em></p>
<p>It is important to realize that exceptions interrupt the normal flow of a program. At the point where the exception occurs, some of the computations that the caller requested may have been done, while others remain undone. In general, bypassing part of the program might mean that an object is left in an invalid or incomplete state, or that a resource is not freed, and so on. Programs that properly “clean up” during exception handling are said to be <em><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1406300" id="filepos1390090">exception safe.</a></em> Writing exception safe code is surprisingly hard, and (largely) beyond the scope of this language Primer.</p>
<p>Some programs use exceptions simply to terminate the program when an exceptional condition occurs. Such programs generally don’t worry about exception safety.</p>
<p>Programs that do handle exceptions and continue processing generally must be constantly aware of whether an exception might occur and what the program must do to ensure that objects are valid, that resources don’t leak, and that the program is restored to an appropriate state.</p>
<p>We will occasionally point out particularly common techniques used to promote exception safety. However, readers whose programs require robust exception handling should be aware that the techniques we cover are insufficient by themselves to achieve exception safety.</p>

<h4 id="filepos1391364"><a id="filepos1391397"></a>5.6.3. Standard Exceptions</h4>
<p>The C++ library defines several classes that it uses to report problems encountered in the functions in the standard library. These exception classes are also intended to be used in the programs we write. These classes are defined in four headers:</p>
<ul><li>The <code>exception</code> header defines the most general kind of exception class named <code>exception</code>. It communicates only that an exception occurred but provides no additional information.</li><li>The <code>stdexcept</code> header defines several general-purpose exception classes, which are listed in <a href="059-5.6._try_blocks_and_exception_handling.html#filepos1392508">Table 5.1</a>.</li></ul>

<p><a id="filepos1392508"></a>Table 5.1. Standard Exception Classes Defined in <code>&lt;stdexcept&gt;</code></p>

| Exception Class    | Function                                                                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `exception`        | The most general kind of problem.                                                    |
| `runtime_error`    | Problem that can be detected only at run time.                                       |
| `range_error`      | Run-time error: result generated outside the range of values that are meaningful.    |
| `overflow_error`   | Run-time error: computation that overflowed.                                         |
| `underflow_error`  | Run-time error: computation that underflowed.                                        |
| `logic_error`      | Error in the logic of the program.                                                   |
| `domain_error`     | Logic error: argument for which no result exists.                                    |
| `invalid_argument` | Logic error: inappropriate argument,                                                 |
| `length_error`     | Logic error: attempt to create an object larger than the maximum size for that type. |
| `out_of_range`     | Logic error: used a value outside the valid range.                                   |

<ul><li>The <code>new</code> header defines the <code>bad_alloc</code> exception type, which we cover in § <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2959483">12.1.2</a> (p. <a href="114-12.1._dynamic_memory_and_smart_pointers.html#filepos2959483">458</a>).</li><li>The <code>type_info</code> header defines the <code>bad_cast</code> exception type, which we cover in § <a href="178-19.2._runtime_type_identification.html#filepos5158705">19.2</a> (p. <a href="178-19.2._runtime_type_identification.html#filepos5158705">825</a>).</li></ul>

<p>The library exception classes have only a few operations. We can create, copy, and assign objects of any of the exception types.</p>
<p>We can only default initialize (§ <a href="022-2.2._variables.html#filepos350704">2.2.1</a>, p. <a href="022-2.2._variables.html#filepos350704">43</a>) <code>exception</code>, <code>bad_alloc</code>, and <code>bad_cast</code> objects; it is not possible to provide an initializer for objects of these exception types.</p>
<p>The other exception types have the opposite behavior: We can initialize those objects from either a <code>string</code> or a C-style string, but we <em>cannot</em> default initialize them. When we create objects of any of these other exception types, we must supply an initializer. That initializer is used to provide additional information about the error that occurred.</p>
<p>The exception types define only a single operation named <code>what</code>. That function takes no arguments and returns a <code>const char*</code> that points to a C-style character string (§ <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos918393">3.5.4</a>, p. <a href="034-3.5._arrays.html#filepos918393">122</a>). The purpose of this C-style character string is to provide some sort of textual description of the exception thrown.</p>
<p><a id="filepos1395337"></a>The contents of the C-style string that <code>what</code> returns depends on the type of the exception object. For the types that take a string initializer, the <code>what</code> function returns that string. For the other types, the value of the string that <code>what</code> returns varies by compiler.</p>

<h3 id="filepos1249036">5.3. Conditional Statements</h3>
<p>C++ provides two statements that allow for conditional execution. The <code>if</code> statement determines the flow of control based on a condition. The <code>switch</code> statement evaluates an integral expression and chooses one of several execution paths based on the expression’s value.</p>
<h4 id="filepos1249590"><a id="filepos1249623"></a>5.3.1. The <code>if</code> Statement</h4>
<Badge type="info" text="Fundamental" />
<p>An <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1408229" id="filepos1249915"><code>if</code>
<strong>statement</strong></a> conditionally executes another statement based on whether a specified condition is true. There are two forms of the <code>if</code>: one with an <code>else</code> branch and one without. The syntactic form of the simple <code>if</code> is</p>

```c++
if (condition)
     statement
```

<p>An <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1407817" id="filepos1250893"><code>if else</code>
<strong>statement</strong></a> has the form</p>

```c++
if (condition)
     statement
else
     statement2
```

<p>In both versions, <em>condition</em> must be enclosed in parentheses. <em>condition</em> can be an expression or an initialized variable declaration (§ <a href="055-5.2._statement_scope.html#filepos1244991">5.2</a>, p. <a href="055-5.2._statement_scope.html#filepos1244991">174</a>). The expression or variable must have a type that is convertible (§ <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1157818">4.11</a>, p. <a href="049-4.11._type_conversions.html#filepos1157818">159</a>) to <code>bool</code>. As usual, either or both <em>statement</em> and <em>statement2</em> can be a block.</p>
<p>If <em>condition</em> is <code>true</code>, then <em>statement</em> is executed. After <em>statement</em> completes, execution continues with the statement following the <code>if</code>.</p>
<p>If <em>condition</em> is <code>false</code>, <em>statement</em> is skipped. In a simple <code>if</code>, execution continues with the statement following the <code>if</code>. In an <code>if else</code>, <em>statement2</em> is executed.</p>
<h5>Using an <code>if else</code> Statement</h5>
<p>To illustrate an <code>if</code> statement, we’ll calculate a letter grade from a numeric grade. We’ll assume that the numeric grades range from zero to 100 inclusive. A grade of 100 gets an “A++,” grades below 60 get an “F,” and the others range in clumps of ten: grades from 60 to 69 inclusive get a “D,” 70 to 79 a “C,” and so on. We’ll use a <code>vector</code> to hold the possible letter grades:</p>

```c++
vector<string> scores = {"F", "D", "C", "B", "A", "A++"};
```

<p>To solve this problem, we can use an <code>if else</code> statement to execute different actions for failing and passing grades:</p>

```c++
// if grade is less than 60 it's an F, otherwise compute a subscript
string lettergrade;
if (grade < 60)
    lettergrade = scores[0];
else
    lettergrade = scores[(grade - 50)/10];
```

<p>Depending on the value of <code>grade</code>, we execute the statement after the <code>if</code> or the one after the <code>else</code>. In the <code>else</code>, we compute a subscript from a grade by reducing the grade to account for the larger range of failing grades. Then we use integer division (§ <a href="040-4.2._arithmetic_operators.html#filepos1028232">4.2</a>, p. <a href="040-4.2._arithmetic_operators.html#filepos1028232">141</a>), which truncates the remainder, to calculate the appropriate <code>scores</code> index.</p>
<h5><a id="filepos1256261"></a>Nested <code>if</code> Statements</h5>
<p>To make our program more interesting, we’ll add a plus or minus to passing grades. We’ll give a plus to grades ending in 8 or 9, and a minus to those ending in 0, 1, or 2:</p>

```c++
if (grade % 10 > 7)
    lettergrade += '+';         // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
else if (grade % 10 < 3)
    lettergrade += '-';         // those ending in 0, 1, or 2 get a -
```

<p>Here we use the modulus operator (§ <a href="040-4.2._arithmetic_operators.html#filepos1028232">4.2</a>, p. <a href="040-4.2._arithmetic_operators.html#filepos1028232">141</a>) to get the remainder and decide based on the remainder whether to add plus or minus.</p>
<p>We next will incorporate the code that adds a plus or minus to the code that fetches the letter grade from scores:</p>

```c++
// if failing grade, no need to check for a plus or minus
if (grade < 60)
    lettergrade = scores[0];
else {
    lettergrade = scores[(grade - 50)/10]; // fetch the letter grade
    if (grade != 100)  // add plus or minus only if not already an A++
        if (grade % 10 > 7)
            lettergrade += '+';  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
        else if (grade % 10 < 3)
            lettergrade += '-';  // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 get a -
}
```

<p>Note that we use a block to enclose the two statements that follow the first <code>else</code>. If the <code>grade</code> is <code>60</code> or more, we have two actions that we need to do: Fetch the letter grade from <code>scores</code>, and conditionally set the plus or minus.</p>
<h5>Watch Your Braces</h5>
<p>It is a common mistake to forget the curly braces when multiple statements must be executed as a block. In the following example, contrary to the indentation, the code to add a plus or minus happens unconditionally:</p>

```c++
if (grade < 60)
    lettergrade = scores[0];
else  // WRONG: missing curly
    lettergrade = scores[(grade - 50)/10];
    // despite appearances, without the curly brace, this code is always executed
    // failing grades will incorrectly get a - or a +
    if (grade != 100)
        if (grade % 10 > 7)
            lettergrade += '+';  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
        else if (grade % 10 < 3)
            lettergrade += '-';  // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 get a -
```

<p>Uncovering this error may be very difficult because the program looks correct.</p>
<p>To avoid such problems, some coding styles recommend always using braces after an <code>if</code> or an <code>else</code> (and also around the bodies of <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> statements).</p>
<p><a id="filepos1264529"></a>Doing so avoids any possible confusion. It also means that the braces are already in place if later modifications of the code require adding statements.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Many editors and development environments have tools to automatically indent source code to match its structure. It is a good idea to use such tools if they are available.</p>
:::

<h5>Dangling <code>else</code></h5>
<p>When we nest an <code>if</code> inside another <code>if</code>, it is possible that there will be more <code>if</code> branches than <code>else</code> branches. Indeed, our grading program has four <code>if</code>s and two <code>else</code>s. The question arises: How do we know to which <code>if</code> a given <code>else</code> belongs?</p>
<p>This problem, usually referred to as a <strong><a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1403298" id="filepos1266322">dangling <code>else</code></a></strong>, is common to many programming languages that have both <code>if</code> and <code>if else</code> statements. Different languages solve this problem in different ways. In C++ the ambiguity is resolved by specifying that each <code>else</code> is matched with the closest preceding unmatched <code>if</code>.</p>
<p>Programmers sometimes get into trouble when they write code that contains more <code>if</code> than <code>else</code> branches. To illustrate the problem, we’ll rewrite the innermost <code>if else</code> that adds a plus or minus using a different set of conditions:</p>

```c++
// WRONG: execution does NOT match indentation; the else goes with the inner if
if (grade % 10 >= 3)
    if (grade % 10 > 7)
        lettergrade += '+';  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
else
    lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 3, 4, 5, 6 will get a minus!
```

<p>The indentation in our code indicates that we intend the <code>else</code> to go with the outer <code>if</code>—we intend for the <code>else</code> branch to be executed when the <code>grade</code> ends in a digit less than <code>3</code>. However, despite our intentions, and contrary to the indentation, the <code>else</code> branch is part of the inner <code>if</code>. This code adds a <code>'-'</code> to grades ending in <code>3</code> to <code>7</code> inclusive! Properly indented to match the actual execution, what we wrote is:</p>

```c++
// indentation matches the execution path, not the programmer's intent
if (grade % 10 >= 3)
    if (grade % 10 > 7)
        lettergrade += '+';  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
    else
        lettergrade += '-';  // grades ending in 3, 4, 5, 6 will get a minus!
```

<h5>Controlling the Execution Path with Braces</h5>
<p>We can make the <code>else</code> part of the outer <code>if</code> by enclosing the inner <code>if</code> in a block:</p>

```c++
// add a plus for grades that end in 8 or 9 and a minus for those ending in 0, 1, or 2
if (grade % 10 >= 3) {
    if (grade % 10 > 7)
        lettergrade += '+';  // grades ending in 8 or 9 get a +
} else                  // curlies force the else to go with the outer if
    lettergrade += '-'; // grades ending in 0, 1, or 2 will get a minus
```

<p><a id="filepos1274681"></a>Statements do not span block boundaries, so the inner <code>if</code> ends at the close curly before the <code>else</code>. The <code>else</code> cannot be part of the inner <code>if</code>. Now, the nearest unmatched <code>if</code> is the outer <code>if</code>, which is what we intended all along.</p>

<h4 id="filepos1278126">5.3.2. The <code>switch</code> Statement</h4>
<p>A <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1409861" id="filepos1278386"><code>switch</code>
<strong>statement</strong></a> provides a convenient way of selecting among a (possibly large) number of fixed alternatives. As one example, suppose that we want to count how often each of the five vowels appears in some segment of text. Our program logic is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Read every character in the input.</li><li>Compare each character to the set of vowels.</li><li>If the character matches one of the vowels, add 1 to that vowel’s count.</li><li>Display the results.</li></ul>

<p>For example, when we run the program on the text of this chapter, the output is</p>

```
Number of vowel a: 3195
Number of vowel e: 6230
Number of vowel i: 3102
Number of vowel o: 3289
Number of vowel u: 1033
```

<p><a id="filepos1280212"></a>We can solve our problem most directly using a <code>switch</code> statement:</p>

```c++
// initialize counters for each vowel
unsigned aCnt = 0, eCnt = 0, iCnt = 0, oCnt = 0, uCnt = 0;
char ch;
while (cin >> ch) {
    // if ch is a vowel, increment the appropriate counter
    switch (ch) {
        case 'a':
            ++aCnt;
            break;
        case 'e':
            ++eCnt;
            break;
        case 'i':
            ++iCnt;
            break;
        case 'o':
            ++oCnt;
            break;
        case 'u':
            ++uCnt;
            break;
    }
}
// print results
cout << "Number of vowel a: \t" << aCnt << '\n'
     << "Number of vowel e: \t" << eCnt << '\n'
     << "Number of vowel i: \t" << iCnt << '\n'
     << "Number of vowel o: \t" << oCnt << '\n'
     << "Number of vowel u: \t" << uCnt << endl;
```

<p>A <code>switch</code> statement executes by evaluating the parenthesized expression that follows the keyword <code>switch</code>. That expression may be an initialized variable declaration (§ <a href="055-5.2._statement_scope.html#filepos1244991">5.2</a>, p. <a href="055-5.2._statement_scope.html#filepos1244991">174</a>). The expression is converted to integral type. The result of the expression is compared with the value associated with each <code>case</code>.</p>
<p>If the expression matches the value of a <code>case</code> label, execution begins with the first statement following that label. Execution continues normally from that statement through the end of the <code>switch</code> or until a <code>break</code> statement.</p>
<p>We’ll look at <code>break</code> statements in detail in § <a href="058-5.5._jump_statements.html#filepos1351310">5.5.1</a> (p. <a href="058-5.5._jump_statements.html#filepos1351310">190</a>), but, briefly, a <code>break</code> interrupts the current control flow. In this case, the <code>break</code> transfers control out of the <code>switch</code>. In this program, the <code>switch</code> is the only statement in the body of a <code>while</code>. Breaking out of this <code>switch</code> returns control to the enclosing <code>while</code>. Because there are no other statements in that <code>while</code>, execution continues at the condition in the <code>while</code>.</p>
<p>If no match is found, execution falls through to the first statement following the <code>switch</code>. As we already know, in this example, exiting the <code>switch</code> returns control to the condition in the <code>while</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>case</code> keyword and its associated value together are known as the <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1401277" id="filepos1285807"><code>case</code>
<strong>label</strong></a>. <code>case</code> labels must be integral constant expressions (§ <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos520427">2.4.4</a>, p. <a href="024-2.4._const_qualifier.html#filepos520427">65</a>):</p>
<p><a id="filepos1286269"></a></p>

```c++
char ch = getVal();
int ival = 42;
switch(ch) {
    case 3.14: // error: noninteger as case label
    case ival: // error: nonconstant as case label
    // . . .
```

<p>It is an error for any two <code>case</code> labels to have the same value. There is also a special-case label, <code>default</code>, which we cover on page <a href="056-5.3._conditional_statements.html#filepos1292423">181</a>.</p>
<h5>Control Flow within a <code>switch</code></h5>
<p>It is important to understand that execution flows across <code>case</code> labels. After a <code>case</code> label is matched, execution starts at that label and continues across all the remaining <code>case</code>s or until the program explicitly interrupts it. To avoid executing code for subsequent <code>case</code>s, we must explicitly tell the compiler to stop execution. Under most conditions, the last statement before the next <code>case</code> label is <code>break</code>.</p>
<p>However, there are situations where the default <code>switch</code> behavior is exactly what is needed. Each <code>case</code> label can have only a single value, but sometimes we have two or more values that share a common set of actions. In such instances, we omit a <code>break</code> statement, allowing the program to <em>fall through</em> multiple <code>case</code> labels.</p>
<p>For example, we might want to count only the total number of vowels:</p>

```c++
unsigned vowelCnt = 0;
// ...
switch (ch)
{
    // any occurrence of a, e, i, o, or u increments vowelCnt
    case 'a':
    case 'e':
    case 'i':
    case 'o':
    case 'u':
       ++vowelCnt;
       break;
}
```

<p>Here we stacked several <code>case</code> labels together with no intervening <code>break</code>. The same code will be executed whenever <code>ch</code> is a vowel.</p>
<p>Because C++ programs are free-form, <code>case</code> labels need not appear on a new line. We can emphasize that the <code>case</code>s represent a range of values by listing them all on a single line:</p>

```c++
switch (ch)
{
    // alternative legal syntax
    case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u':
       ++vowelCnt;
       break;
}
```

::: tip
<a id="filepos1292423"></a><p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Omitting a <code>break</code> at the end of a <code>case</code> happens rarely. If you do omit a <code>break</code>, include a comment explaining the logic.</p>
:::

<h5>Forgetting a <code>break</code> Is a Common Source of Bugs</h5>
<p>It is a common misconception to think that only the statements associated with the matched <code>case</code> label are executed. For example, here is an <em>incorrect</em> implementation of our vowel-counting <code>switch</code> statement:</p>

```c++
// warning: deliberately incorrect!
switch (ch) {
    case 'a':
        ++aCnt;  // oops: should have a break statement
    case 'e':
        ++eCnt;  // oops: should have a break statement
    case 'i':
        ++iCnt;  // oops: should have a break statement
    case 'o':
        ++oCnt;  // oops: should have a break statement
    case 'u':
        ++uCnt;
}
```

<p>To understand what happens, assume that the value of <code>ch</code> is <code>'e'</code>. Execution jumps to the code following the <code>case 'e'</code> label, which increments <code>eCnt</code>. Execution <em>continues</em> across the <code>case</code> labels, incrementing <code>iCnt</code>, <code>oCnt</code>, and <code>uCnt</code> as well.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>Although it is not necessary to include a <code>break</code> after the last label of a <code>switch</code>, the safest course is to provide one. That way, if an additional <code>case</code> is added later, the <code>break</code> is already in place.</p>
:::

<h5>The <code>default</code> Label</h5>
<p>The statements following the <a href="061-defined_terms.html#filepos1404313" id="filepos1297140"><code>default</code>
<strong>label</strong></a> are executed when no <code>case</code> label matches the value of the <code>switch</code> expression. For example, we might add a counter to track how many nonvowels we read. We’ll increment this counter, which we’ll name <code>otherCnt</code>, in the <code>default</code> case:</p>

```c++
   // if ch is a vowel, increment the appropriate counter
   switch (ch) {
       case 'a': case 'e': case 'i': case 'o': case 'u':
           ++vowelCnt;
           break;
       default:
           ++otherCnt;
           break;
   }
}
```

<p><a id="filepos1298987"></a>In this version, if <code>ch</code> is not a vowel, execution will start at the <code>default</code> label and we’ll increment <code>otherCnt</code>.</p>

::: tip
<p>Best Practices</p>
<p>It can be useful to define a <code>default</code> label even if there is no work for the <code>default</code> case. Defining an empty <code>default</code> section indicates to subsequent readers that the case was considered.</p>
:::

<p>A label may not stand alone; it must precede a statement or another <code>case</code> label. If a <code>switch</code> ends with a <code>default</code> case that has no work to do, then the <code>default</code> label must be followed by a null statement or an empty block.</p>
<h5>Variable Definitions inside the Body of a <code>switch</code></h5>
<p>As we’ve seen, execution in a <code>switch</code> can jump across <code>case</code> labels. When execution jumps to a particular <code>case</code>, any code that occurred inside the <code>switch</code> before that label is ignored. The fact that code is bypassed raises an interesting question: What happens if the code that is skipped includes a variable definition?</p>
<p>The answer is that it is illegal to jump from a place where a variable with an initializer is out of scope to a place where that variable is in scope:</p>

```c++
case true:
    // this switch statement is illegal because these initializations might be bypassed
    string file_name; // error: control bypasses an implicitly initialized variable
    int ival = 0;     // error: control bypasses an explicitly initialized variable
    int jval;         // ok: because jval is not initialized
    break;
case false:
    // ok: jval is in scope but is uninitialized
    jval = next_num(); // ok: assign a value to jval
    if (file_name.empty()) // file_name is in scope but wasn't initialized
        // ...
```

<p>If this code were legal, then any time control jumped to the <code>false</code> case, it would bypass the initialization of <code>file_name</code> and <code>ival</code>. Those variables would be in scope. Code following <code>false</code> could use those variables. However, these variables would not have been initialized. As a result, the language does not allow us to jump over an initialization if the initialized variable is in scope at the point to which control transfers.</p>
<p>If we need to define and initialize a variable for a particular <code>case</code>, we can do so by defining the variable inside a block, thereby ensuring that the variable is out of scope at the point of any subsequent label.</p>

```c++
case true:
    {
       // ok: declaration statement within a statement block
       string file_name = get_file_name();
       // ...
    }
    break;
case false:
       if (file_name.empty())  // error: file_name is not in scope
```

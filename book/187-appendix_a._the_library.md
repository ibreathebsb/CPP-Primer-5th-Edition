<p>This Appendix contains additional details about the algorithms and random number parts of the library. We also provide a list of all the names we used from the standard library along with the name of the header that defines that name.</p>
<p>In <a href="097-chapter_10._generic_algorithms.html#filepos2454824">Chapter 10</a> we used some of the more common algorithms and described the architecture that underlies the algorithms. In this Appendix, we list all the algorithms, organized by the kinds of operations they perform.</p>
<p>In § <a href="166-17.4._random_numbers.html#filepos4713529">17.4</a> (p. <a href="166-17.4._random_numbers.html#filepos4713529">745</a>) we described the architecture of the random number library and used several of the library’s distribution types. The library defines a number or random number engines and 20 different distributions. In this Appendix, we list all the engines and distributions.</p>

<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>At this point, we have defined an interface for our class; but nothing forces users to use that interface. Our class is not yet encapsulated—users can reach inside a <code>Sales_data</code> object and meddle with its implementation. In C++ we use <strong><a href="080-defined_terms.html#filepos2054821" id="filepos1833906">access specifiers</a></strong> to enforce encapsulation:</p>
<ul><li>Members defined after a <code>public</code> specifier are accessible to all parts of the program. The <code>public</code> members define the interface to the class.</li><li>Members defined after a <code>private</code> specifier are accessible to the member functions of the class but are not accessible to code that uses the class. The <code>private</code> sections encapsulate (i.e., hide) the implementation.</li></ul>

<p>Redefining <code>Sales_data</code> once again, we now have</p>

```c++
class Sales_data {
public:            // access specifier added
    Sales_data() = default;
    Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p):
               bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { }
    Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { }
    Sales_data(std::istream&);
    std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; }
    Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&);
private:            // access specifier added
    double avg_price() const
        { return units_sold ? revenue/units_sold : 0; }
    std::string bookNo;
    unsigned units_sold = 0;
    double revenue = 0.0;
};
```

<p>The constructors and member functions that are part of the interface (e.g., <code>isbn</code> and <code>combine</code>) follow the <code>public</code> specifier; the data members and the functions that are part of the implementation follow the <code>private</code> specifier.</p>
<p>A class may contain zero or more access specifiers, and there are no restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear. Each access specifier specifies the access level of the succeeding members. The specified access level remains in effect until the next access specifier or the end of the class body.</p>
<h4>Using the <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code> Keyword</h4>
<p>We also made another, more subtle, change: We used the <a href="080-defined_terms.html#filepos2056547" id="filepos1838019"><code>class</code>
<strong>keyword</strong></a> rather than <code>struct</code> to open the class definition. This change is strictly stylistic; we can define a class type using either keyword. The only difference between <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> is the default access level.</p>
<p>A class may define members before the first access specifier. Access to such members depends on how the class is defined. If we use the <code>struct</code> keyword, the members defined before the first access specifier are <code>public;</code> if we use <code>class</code>, then the members are <code>private</code>.</p>
<p><a id="filepos1839330"></a>As a matter of programming style, when we define a class intending for all of its members to be <code>public</code>, we use <code>struct</code>. If we intend to have <code>private</code> members, then we use <code>class</code>.</p>

<h4 id="filepos1841962">7.2.1. Friends</h4>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00009.jpg"/>
<p>Now that the data members of <code>Sales_data</code> are <code>private</code>, our <code>read, print</code>, and <code>add</code> functions will no longer compile. The problem is that although these functions are part of the <code>Sales_data</code> interface, they are not members of the class.</p>
<p>A class can allow another class or function to access its non<code>public</code> members by making that class or function a <strong><a href="080-defined_terms.html#filepos2061369" id="filepos1842929">friend</a></strong>. A class makes a function its friend by including a declaration for that function preceded by the keyword <code>friend</code>:</p>

```c++
class Sales_data {
// friend declarations for nonmember Sales_data operations added
friend Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&);
friend std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&);
friend std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&);
// other members and access specifiers as before
public:
    Sales_data() = default;
    Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p):
               bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { }
    Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { }
    Sales_data(std::istream&);
    std::string isbn() const { return bookNo; }
    Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&);
private:
    std::string bookNo;
    unsigned units_sold = 0;
    double revenue = 0.0;
};
// declarations for nonmember parts of the Sales_data interface
Sales_data add(const Sales_data&, const Sales_data&);
std::istream &read(std::istream&, Sales_data&);
std::ostream &print(std::ostream&, const Sales_data&);
```

<p>Friend declarations may appear only inside a class definition; they may appear anywhere in the class. Friends are not members of the class and are not affected by the access control of the section in which they are declared. We’ll have more to say about friendship in § <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1906774">7.3.4</a> (p. <a href="075-7.3._additional_class_features.html#filepos1906774">279</a>).</p>

::: tip
<p>Ordinarily it is a good idea to group friend declarations together at the beginning or end of the class definition.</p>

<p>Key Concept: Benefits of Encapsulation</p>
<p>Encapsulation provides two important advantages:</p>
<p>• User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulated object.</p>
<p>• The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without requiring changes in user-level code.</p>
<p>By defining data members as <code>private</code>, the class author is free to make changes in the data. If the implementation changes, only the class code needs to be examined to see what effect the change may have. User code needs to change only when the interface changes. If the data are <code>public</code>, then any code that used the old data members might be broken. It would be necessary to locate and rewrite any code that relied on the old representation before the program could be used again.</p>
<p>Another advantage of making data members <code>private</code> is that the data are protected from mistakes that users might introduce. If there is a bug that corrupts an object’s state, the places to look for the bug are localized: Only code that is part of the implementation could be responsible for the error. The search for the mistake is limited, greatly easing the problems of maintenance and program correctness.</p>
<p>Although user code need not change when a class definition changes, the source files that use a class must be recompiled any time the class changes.</p>
:::

<h5>Declarations for Friends</h5>
<img alt="Image" src="/images/00011.jpg"/>
<p>A friend declaration only specifies access. It is not a general declaration of the function. If we want users of the class to be able to call a friend function, then we must also declare the function separately from the friend declaration.</p>
<p>To make a friend visible to users of the class, we usually declare each friend (outside the class) in the same header as the class itself. Thus, our <code>Sales_data</code> header should provide separate declarations (aside from the friend declarations inside the class body) for <code>read</code>, <code>print</code>, and <code>add</code>.</p>

::: info
<p>Many compilers do not enforce the rule that friend functions must be declared <em>outside</em> the class before they can be used.</p>
:::

<p><a id="filepos1850253"></a>Some compilers allow calls to a <code>friend</code> function when there is no ordinary declaration for that function. Even if your compiler allows such calls, it is a good idea to provide separate declarations for <code>friend</code>s. That way you won’t have to change your code if you use a compiler that enforces this rule.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 7.21:</strong> Update your <code>Sales_data</code> class to hide its implementation. The programs you’ve written to use <code>Sales_data</code> operations should still continue to work. Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work.</p>

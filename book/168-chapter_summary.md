<p>This chapter covered additional IO operations and four library types: <code>tuple</code>, <code>bitset</code>, regular expressions, and random numbers.</p>
<p>A <code>tuple</code> is a template that allows us to bundle together members of disparate types into a single object. Each <code>tuple</code> contains a specified number of members, but the library imposes no limit on the number of members we can define for a given <code>tuple</code> type.</p>
<p>A <code>bitset</code> lets us define collections of bits of a specified size. The size of a <code>bitset</code> is not constrained to match any of the integral types, and can even exceed them. In addition to supporting the normal bitwise operators (ยง <a href="046-4.8._the_bitwise_operators.html#filepos1120642">4.8</a>, p. <a href="046-4.8._the_bitwise_operators.html#filepos1120642">152</a>), <code>bitset</code> defines a number of named operations that let us manipulate the state of particular bits in the <code>bitset</code>.</p>
<p>The regular-expression library provides a collection of classes and functions: The <code>regex</code> class manages regular expressions written in one of several common regular-expression languages. The match classes hold information about a specific match. These classes are used by the <code>regex_search</code> and <code>regex_match</code> functions. These functions take a <code>regex</code> object and a character sequence and detect whether the regular expression in that <code>regex</code> matches the given character sequence. The <code>regex</code> iterator types are iterator adaptors that use <code>regex_search</code> to iterate through an input sequence and return each matching subsequence. There is also a <code>regex_replace</code> function that lets us replace the matched part of a given input sequence with a specified alternative.</p>
<p>The random-number library is a collection of random-number engines and distribution classes. A random-number engine returns a sequence of uniformly distributed integral values. The library defines several engines that have different performance characteristics. The <code>default_random_engine</code> is defined as the engine that should be suitable for most casual uses. The library also defines 20 distribution types. These distribution types use an engine to deliver random numbers of a specified type in a given range that are distributed according to a specified probability distribution.</p>
